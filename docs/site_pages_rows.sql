'2025-03-25 05:14:13.610403+00'), ('2', 'https://ai.pydantic.dev/', '1', 'Introduction to PydanticAI', 'PydanticAI aims to enhance GenAI app development by providing a framework that embodies the fast and efficient experience associated with FastAPI. Developed by the Pydantic team, it is model-agnostic and supports various LLMs, integrating smoothly with Pydantic Logfire for advanced debugging and monitoring.', 'Similarly, virtually every agent framework and LLM library in Python uses Pydantic, yet when we began to use LLMs in [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire), we couldn't find anything that gave us the same feeling.

We built PydanticAI with one simple aim: to bring that FastAPI feeling to GenAI app development.

## Why use PydanticAI

  * **Built by the Pydantic Team** : Built by the team behind [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) (the validation layer of the OpenAI SDK, the Anthropic SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, Transformers, CrewAI, Instructor and many more).

  * **Model-agnostic** : Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Deepseek, Ollama, Groq, Cohere, and Mistral, and there is a simple interface to implement support for [other models](models/).

  * **Pydantic Logfire Integration** : Seamlessly [integrates](logfire/) with [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for real-time debugging, performance monitoring, and behavior tracking of your LLM-powered applications.

  * **Type-safe** : Designed to make [type checking](agents/#static-type-checking) as powerful and informative as possible for you.

  * **Python-centric Design** : Leverages Python's familiar control flow and agent composition to build your AI-driven projects, making it easy to apply standard Python best practices you'd use in any other (non-AI) project.

  * **Structured Responses** : Harnesses the power of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) to [validate and structure](results/#structured-result-validation) model outputs, ensuring responses are consistent across runs.

  * **Dependency Injection System** : Offers an optional [dependency injection](dependencies/) system to provide data and services to your agent's [system prompts](agents/#system-prompts), [tools](tools/) and [result validators](results/#result-validators-functions). This is useful for testing and eval-driven iterative development.

  * **Streamed Responses** : Provides the ability to [stream](results/#streamed-results) LLM outputs continuously, with immediate validation, ensuring rapid and accurate results.

  * **Graph Support** : [Pydantic Graph](graph/) provides a powerful way to define graphs using typing hints, this is useful in complex applications where standard control flow can degrade to spaghetti code.

## Hello World Example

Here's a minimal example of PydanticAI:

hello_world.py
    
    
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    
    agent = Agent(  # (1)!
        'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash',
        system_prompt='Be concise, reply with one sentence.',  # (2)!
    )
    
    result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')  # (3)!
    print(result.data)
    """
    The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.
    """
    

  1. We configure the agent to use [Gemini 1.5's Flash](api/models/gemini/) model, but you can also set the model when running the agent.
  2. Register a static [system prompt](agents/#system-prompts) using a keyword argument to the agent.
  3. [Run the agent](agents/#running-agents) synchronously, conducting a conversation with the LLM.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

The exchange should be very short: PydanticAI will send the system prompt and the user query to the LLM, the model will return a text response.

Not very interesting yet, but we can easily add "tools", dynamic system prompts, and structured responses to build more powerful agents.

highlighting the agent's generic dependencies and result types. It details the use of OpenAI's GPT-4o model, the role of the `SupportDependencies` dataclass for data and logic injection, the benefits of type-safe dependency management, and the registration of static system prompts with the agent.', '1. This [agent](agents/) will act as first-tier support in a bank. Agents are generic in the type of dependencies they accept and the type of result they return. In this case, the support agent has type `Agent[SupportDependencies, SupportResult]`.
  2. Here we configure the agent to use [OpenAI's GPT-4o model](api/models/openai/), you can also set the model when running the agent.
  3. The `SupportDependencies` dataclass is used to pass data, connections, and logic into the model that will be needed when running [system prompt](agents/#system-prompts) and [tool](tools/) functions. PydanticAI's system of dependency injection provides a [type-safe](agents/#static-type-checking) way to customise the behavior of your agents, and can be especially useful when running [unit tests](testing-evals/) and evals.
  4. Static [system prompts](agents/#system-prompts) can be registered with the [`system_prompt` keyword argument](api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__) to the agent.
  5. Dynamic [system prompts](agents/#system-prompts) can be registered with the [`@agent.system_prompt`](api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.system_prompt) decorator, and can make use of dependency injection. Dependencies are carried via the [`RunContext`](api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext) argument, which is parameterized with the `deps_type` from above. If the type annotation here is wrong, static type checkers will catch it.
  6. [`tool`](tools/) let you register functions which the LLM may call while responding to a user. Again, dependencies are carried via [`RunContext`](api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext), any other arguments become the tool schema passed to the LLM. Pydantic is used to validate these arguments, and errors are passed back to the LLM so it can retry.
  7. The docstring of a tool is also passed to the LLM as the description of the tool. Parameter descriptions are [extracted](tools/#function-tools-and-schema) from the docstring and added to the parameter schema sent to the LLM.
  8. [Run the agent](agents/#running-agents) asynchronously, conducting a conversation with the LLM until a final response is reached. Even in this fairly simple case, the agent will exchange multiple messages with the LLM as tools are called to retrieve a result.
  9. The response from the agent will, be guaranteed to be a `SupportResult`, if validation fails [reflection](agents/#reflection-and-self-correction) will mean the agent is prompted to try again.
  10. The result will be validated with Pydantic to guarantee it is a `SupportResult`, since the agent is generic, it'll also be typed as a `SupportResult` to aid with static type checking.
  11. In a real use case, you'd add more tools and a longer system prompt to the agent to extend the context it's equipped with and support it can provide.
  12. This is a simple sketch of a database connection, used to keep the example short and readable. In reality, you'd be connecting to an external database (e.g. PostgreSQL) to get information about customers.
  13. This [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) model is used to constrain the structured data returned by the agent. From this simple definition, Pydantic builds the JSON Schema that tells the LLM how to return the data, and performs validation to guarantee the data is correct at the end of the run.

Complete `bank_support.py` example

The code included here is incomplete for the sake of brevity (the definition of `DatabaseConn` is missing); you can find the complete `bank_support.py` example [here](examples/bank-support/).

## Instrumentation with Pydantic Logfire

To understand the flow of the above runs, we can watch the agent in action using Pydantic Logfire.

To do this, we need to set up logfire, and add the following to our code:

bank_support_with_logfire.py
    
    
    ...
    from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
    
    from bank_database import DatabaseConn
    
    import logfire
    
    logfire.configure()  # (1)!
    logfire.instrument_asyncpg()  # (2)!
    
    ...
    
    support_agent = Agent(
        'openai:gpt-4o',
        deps_type=SupportDependencies,
        result_type=SupportResult,
        system_prompt=(
            'You are a support agent in our bank, give the '
            'customer support and judge the risk level of their query.'
        ),
        instrument=True,
    )
    

  1. Configure logfire, this will fail if project is not set up.
  2. In our demo, `DatabaseConn` uses [`asyncpg`]() to connect to a PostgreSQL database, so [`logfire.instrument_asyncpg()`](https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/) is used to log the database queries.

That's enough to get the following view of your agent in action:

ensure type safety, clarity, testability, and production readiness. Dependencies can be any Python type, with dataclasses serving as useful containers for multiple dependencies. An example demonstrates how to define an agent with dependencies.', 'Matching PydanticAI's design philosophy, our dependency system tries to use existing best practice in Python development rather than inventing esoteric "magic", this should make dependencies type-safe, understandable easier to test and ultimately easier to deploy in production. Defining Dependencies Dependencies can be any python type. While in simple cases you might be able to pass a single object as a dependency (e.g. an HTTP connection), [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses) are generally a convenient container when your dependencies included multiple objects. Here's an example of defining an agent that requires dependencies. (**Note:** dependencies aren't actually used in this example, see Accessing Dependencies below) unused_dependencies.py

          1. Define a dataclass to hold dependencies.
          2. Pass the dataclass type to the `deps_type` argument of the [`Agent` constructor](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__). **Note** : we're passing the type here, NOT an instance, this parameter is not actually used at runtime, it's here so we can get full type checking of the agent.
          3. When running the agent, pass an instance of the dataclass to the `deps` parameter.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ Accessing Dependencies Dependencies are accessed through the [`RunContext`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext) type, this should be the first parameter of system prompt functions etc. system_prompt_dependencies.py

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ Asynchronous vs. Synchronous dependencies [System prompt functions](../agents/#system-prompts), [function tools](../tools/) and [result validators](../results/#result-validators-functions) are all run in the async context of an agent run. If these functions are not coroutines (e.g. `async def`) they are called with [`run_in_executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) in a thread pool, it's therefore marginally preferable to use `async` methods where dependencies perform IO, although synchronous dependencies should work fine too. `run` vs. `run_sync` and Asynchronous vs. Synchronous dependencies Whether you use synchronous or asynchronous dependencies, is completely independent of whether you use `run` or `run_sync` â `run_sync` is just a wrapper around `run` and agents are always run in an async context. Here's the same example as above, but with a synchronous dependency: sync_dependencies.py

place of an asynchronous `httpx.AsyncClient` for dependency management. It illustrates how the system prompt function is implemented as a plain function rather than a coroutine. Additional context mentions the application of dependencies in tools and result validators, suggesting that the provided example can be executed directly with a minor addition.', '1. Here we use a synchronous `httpx.Client` instead of an asynchronous `httpx.AsyncClient`.
          2. To match the synchronous dependency, the system prompt function is now a plain function, not a coroutine.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ Full Example As well as system prompts, dependencies can be used in [tools](../tools/) and [result validators](../results/#result-validators-functions). full_example.py

To pass `RunContext` to a tool, use the [`tool`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.tool) decorator.
          2. `RunContext` may optionally be passed to a [`result_validator`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.result_validator) function as the first argument.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ Overriding Dependencies When testing agents, it's useful to be able to customise dependencies. While this can sometimes be done by calling the agent directly within unit tests, we can also override dependencies while calling application code which in turn calls the agent. This is done via the [`override`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.override) method on the agent. joke_app.py

                        class TestMyDeps(MyDeps):  # (1)!

                                return 'test prompt'
                        
                        
                        async def test_application_code():
                            test_deps = TestMyDeps('test_key', None)  # (2)!
                            with joke_agent.override(deps=test_deps):  # (3)!
                                joke = await application_code('Tell me a joke.')  # (4)!
                            assert joke.startswith('Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal?')
                        

              1. Define a subclass of `MyDeps` in tests to customise the system prompt factory.
              2. Create an instance of the test dependency, we don't need to pass an `http_client` here as it's not used.
              3. Override the dependencies of the agent for the duration of the `with` block, `test_deps` will be used when the agent is run.
              4. Now we can safely call our application code, the agent will use the overridden dependencies.

Agents Introduction Agents are PydanticAI's primary interface for interacting with LLMs. In some use cases a single Agent will control an entire application or component, but multiple agents can also interact to embody more complex workflows. The [`Agent`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent) class has full API documentation, but conceptually you can think of an agent as a container for: **Component** | **Description**  
---|---  
System prompt(s) | A set of instructions for the LLM written by the developer.  
[Function tool(s)](../tools/) | Functions that the LLM may call to get information while generating a response.  
[Structured result type](../results/) | The structured datatype the LLM must return at the end of a run, if specified.  
[Dependency type constraint](../dependencies/) | System prompt functions, tools, and result validators may all use dependencies when they're run.  
[LLM model](../api/models/base/) | Optional default LLM model associated with the agent. Can also be specified when running the agent.  
Model Settings | Optional default model settings to help fine tune requests. Can also be specified when running the agent.  
In typing terms, agents are generic in their dependency and result types, e.g., an agent which required dependencies of type `Foobar` and returned results of type `list[str]` would have type `Agent[Foobar, list[str]]`. In practice, you shouldn't need to care about this, it should just mean your IDE can tell you when you have the right type, and if you choose to use static type checking it should work well with PydanticAI. Here's a toy example of an agent that simulates a roulette wheel: roulette_wheel.py
                
                                from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

integer and returns a boolean. It details the definition of a tool for checking if a square is a winner, emphasizing the importance of correct dependency type and the possibility of using random integers. The agent's result will be validated to ensure it is a boolean, and it highlights the reuse of agents across applications similar to FastAPI applications.', '1. Create an agent, which expects an integer dependency and returns a boolean result. This agent will have type `Agent[int, bool]`.
          2. Define a tool that checks if the square is a winner. Here [`RunContext`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext) is parameterized with the dependency type `int`; if you got the dependency type wrong you'd get a typing error.
          3. In reality, you might want to use a random number here e.g. `random.randint(0, 36)`.
          4. `result.data` will be a boolean indicating if the square is a winner. Pydantic performs the result validation, it'll be typed as a `bool` since its type is derived from the `result_type` generic parameter of the agent.
Agents are designed for reuse, like FastAPI Apps Agents are intended to be instantiated once (frequently as module globals) and reused throughout your application, similar to a small [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/fastapi/#fastapi.FastAPI) app or an [APIRouter](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/apirouter/#fastapi.APIRouter). Running Agents There are four ways to run an agent:
          1. [`agent.run()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run) â a coroutine which returns a [`RunResult`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult) containing a completed response.
          2. [`agent.run_sync()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_sync) â a plain, synchronous function which returns a [`RunResult`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult) containing a completed response (internally, this just calls `loop.run_until_complete(self.run())`).
          3. [`agent.run_stream()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream) â a coroutine which returns a [`StreamedRunResult`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult), which contains methods to stream a response as an async iterable.
          4. [`agent.iter()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.iter) â a context manager which returns an [`AgentRun`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRun), an async-iterable over the nodes of the agent's underlying [`Graph`](../api/pydantic_graph/graph/#pydantic_graph.graph.Graph).
Here's a simple example demonstrating the first three: run_agent.py
                
                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                
                agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
                
                result_sync = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of Italy?')
                print(result_sync.data)
                #> Rome
                
                
                async def main():
                    result = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
                    print(result.data)
                    #> Paris
                
                    async with agent.run_stream('What is the capital of the UK?') as response:

`asyncio.run(main())`. It outlines the integration of `pydantic-graph` for managing execution flow, highlighting its capability as a standalone library for workflows. Users can traverse the agent's graph with ease, but deeper control is available for those needing insight into tool invocations.', '_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ You can also pass messages from previous runs to continue a conversation or provide context, as described in [Messages and Chat History](../message-history/). Iterating Over an Agent's Graph Under the hood, each `Agent` in PydanticAI uses **pydantic-graph** to manage its execution flow. **pydantic-graph** is a generic, type-centric library for building and running finite state machines in Python. It doesn't actually depend on PydanticAI â you can use it standalone for workflows that have nothing to do with GenAI â but PydanticAI makes use of it to orchestrate the handling of model requests and model responses in an agent's run. In many scenarios, you don't need to worry about pydantic-graph at all; calling `agent.run(...)` simply traverses the underlying graph from start to finish. However, if you need deeper insight or control â for example to capture each tool invocation, or to inject your own logic at specific stages â PydanticAI exposes the lower-level iteration process via [`Agent.iter`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.iter). This method returns an [`AgentRun`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRun), which you can async-iterate over, or manually drive node-by-node via the [`next`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRun.next) method. Once the agent's graph returns an [`End`](../api/pydantic_graph/nodes/#pydantic_graph.nodes.End), you have the final result along with a detailed history of all steps. `async for` iteration Here's an example of using `async for` with `iter` to record each node the agent executes: agent_iter_async_for.py

Using `.next(...)` manually You can also drive the iteration manually by passing the node you want to run next to the `AgentRun.next(...)` method.

          1. We start by grabbing the first node that will be run in the agent's graph.
          2. The agent run is finished once an `End` node has been produced; instances of `End` cannot be passed to `next`.
          3. When you call `await agent_run.next(node)`, it executes that node in the agent's graph, updates the run's history, and returns the _next_ node to run.
          4. You could also inspect or mutate the new `node` here as needed.
Accessing usage and the final result You can retrieve usage statistics (tokens, requests, etc.) at any time from the [`AgentRun`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRun) object via `agent_run.usage()`. This method returns a [`Usage`](../api/usage/#pydantic_ai.usage.Usage) object containing the usage data. Once the run finishes, `agent_run.final_result` becomes a [`AgentRunResult`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult) object containing the final output (and related metadata).

Additional Configuration Usage Limits PydanticAI offers a [`UsageLimits`](../api/usage/#pydantic_ai.usage.UsageLimits) structure to help you limit your usage (tokens and/or requests) on model runs. You can apply these settings by passing the `usage_limits` argument to the `run{_sync,_stream}` functions. Consider the following example, where we limit the number of response tokens:

          1. This tool has the ability to retry 5 times before erroring, simulating a tool that might get stuck in a loop.
          2. This run will error after 3 requests, preventing the infinite tool calling.
Note This is especially relevant if you've registered many tools. The `request_limit` can be used to prevent the model from calling them in a loop too many times. Model (Run) Settings PydanticAI offers a [`settings.ModelSettings`](../api/settings/#pydantic_ai.settings.ModelSettings) structure to help you fine tune your requests. This structure allows you to configure common parameters that influence the model's behavior, such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `timeout`, and more. There are two ways to apply these settings: 1\. Passing to `run{_sync,_stream}` functions via the `model_settings` argument. This allows for fine-tuning on a per-request basis. 2\. Setting during [`Agent`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent) initialization via the `model_settings` argument. These settings will be applied by default to all subsequent run calls using said agent. However, `model_settings` provided during a specific run call will override the agent's default settings. For example, if you'd like to set the `temperature` setting to `0.0` to ensure less random behavior, you can do the following:
                
                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                
                agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
                
                result_sync = agent.run_sync(
                    'What is the capital of Italy?', model_settings={'temperature': 0.0}
                )

Runs vs. Conversations An agent **run** might represent an entire conversation â there's no limit to how many messages can be exchanged in a single run. However, a **conversation** might also be composed of multiple runs, especially if you need to maintain state between separate interactions or API calls. Here's an example of a conversation comprised of multiple runs: conversation_example.py

Continue the conversation; without `message_history` the model would not know who "his" was referring to.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Type safe by design PydanticAI is designed to work well with static type checkers, like mypy and pyright. Typing is (somewhat) optional PydanticAI is designed to make type checking as useful as possible for you if you choose to use it, but you don't have to use types everywhere all the time. That said, because PydanticAI uses Pydantic, and Pydantic uses type hints as the definition for schema and validation, some types (specifically type hints on parameters to tools, and the `result_type` arguments to [`Agent`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent)) are used at runtime. We (the library developers) have messed up if type hints are confusing you more than helping you, if you find this, please create an [issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues) explaining what's annoying you! In particular, agents are generic in both the type of their dependencies and the type of results they return, so you can use the type hints to ensure you're using the right types. Consider the following script with type mistakes: type_mistakes.py
                
                                from dataclasses import dataclass
                
                from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
                
                
                @dataclass
                class User:
                    name: str
                
                
                agent = Agent(
                    'test',
                    deps_type=User,  # (1)!
                    result_type=bool,
                )
                
                
                @agent.system_prompt
                def add_user_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:  # (2)!
                    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."
                
                
                def foobar(x: bytes) -> None:
                    pass
                
                
                result = agent.run_sync('Does their name start with "A"?', deps=User('Anne'))
                foobar(result.data)  # (3)!
                

          1. The agent is defined as expecting an instance of `User` as `deps`.
          2. But here `add_user_name` is defined as taking a `str` as the dependency, not a `User`.
          3. Since the agent is defined as returning a `bool`, this will raise a type error since `foobar` expects `bytes`.
Running `mypy` on this will give the following output:
                
                                â¤ uv run mypy type_mistakes.py
                type_mistakes.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "system_prompt" of "Agent" has incompatible type "Callable[[RunContext[str]], str]"; expected "Callable[[RunContext[User]], str]"  [arg-type]
                type_mistakes.py:28: error: Argument 1 to "foobar" has incompatible type "bool"; expected "bytes"  [arg-type]
                Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
                

Running `pyright` would identify the same issues. System Prompts System prompts might seem simple at first glance since they're just strings (or sequences of strings that are concatenated), but crafting the right system prompt is key to getting the model to behave as you want. Generally, system prompts fall into two categories:
          1. **Static system prompts** : These are known when writing the code and can be defined via the `system_prompt` parameter of the [`Agent` constructor](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__).
          2. **Dynamic system prompts** : These depend in some way on context that isn't known until runtime, and should be defined via functions decorated with [`@agent.system_prompt`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.system_prompt).
You can add both to a single agent; they're appended in the order they're defined at runtime. Here's an example using both types of system prompts: system_prompts.py
                
                                from datetime import date
                
                from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
                
                agent = Agent(
                    'openai:gpt-4o',
                    deps_type=str,  # (1)!
                    system_prompt="Use the customer's name while replying to them.",  # (2)!
                )
                
                
                @agent.system_prompt  # (3)!
                def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
                    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."
                
                
                @agent.system_prompt
                def add_the_date() -> str:  # (4)!
                    return f'The date is {date.today()}.'
                
                
                result = agent.run_sync('What is the date?', deps='Frank')

use of string dependencies and both static and dynamic system prompts. It highlights the distinction between prompts defined at creation and those defined via decorators utilizing `RunContext` for runtime information. It also covers error handling, including reflection, self-correction, and the ability to raise `ModelRetry` exceptions for validation errors.', '1. The agent expects a string dependency.
          2. Static system prompt defined at agent creation time.
          3. Dynamic system prompt defined via a decorator with [`RunContext`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext), this is called just after `run_sync`, not when the agent is created, so can benefit from runtime information like the dependencies used on that run.
          4. Another dynamic system prompt, system prompts don't have to have the `RunContext` parameter.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Reflection and self-correction Validation errors from both function tool parameter validation and [structured result validation](../results/#structured-result-validation) can be passed back to the model with a request to retry. You can also raise [`ModelRetry`](../api/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelRetry) from within a [tool](../tools/) or [result validator function](../results/#result-validators-functions) to tell the model it should retry generating a response.
          * The default retry count is **1** but can be altered for the [entire agent](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__), a [specific tool](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.tool), or a [result validator](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__).
          * You can access the current retry count from within a tool or result validator via [`ctx.retry`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext).

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Note If you call [`run`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run), [`run_sync`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_sync), or [`run_stream`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream) more than once within a single `capture_run_messages` context, `messages` will represent the messages exchanged during the first call only.

Command Line Interface (CLI) **PydanticAI** comes with a simple reference CLI application which you can use to interact with various LLMs directly from the command line. It provides a convenient way to chat with language models and quickly get answers right in the terminal. We originally developed this CLI for our own use, but found ourselves using it so frequently that we decided to share it as part of the PydanticAI package. We plan to continue adding new features, such as interaction with MCP servers, access to tools, and more. Installation To use the CLI, you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `cli` optional group: pipuv
                
                                pip install "pydantic-ai[cli]"
                
                
                                uv add "pydantic-ai[cli]"
                

To enable command-line argument autocompletion, run:

provider and run the command `pai` to start an interactive session with the AI model. You can use commands like `/exit`, `/markdown`, and `/multiline` in the session. Additionally, you can specify a model using the `--model` flag.', 'Usage You'll need to set an environment variable depending on the provider you intend to use. If using OpenAI, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:
                
                                export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
                

Then simply run:
                
                                $ pai

          * `/exit`: Exit the session
          * `/markdown`: Show the last response in markdown format
          * `/multiline`: Toggle multiline input mode (use Ctrl+D to submit)

Audio Input Info Some models do not support audio input. Please check the model's documentation to confirm whether it supports audio input. You can provide audio input using either [`AudioUrl`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.AudioUrl) or [`BinaryContent`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.BinaryContent). The process is analogous to the examples above. Document Input Info Some models do not support document input. Please check the model's documentation to confirm whether it supports document input. Warning When using Gemini models, the document content will always be sent as binary data, regardless of whether you use `DocumentUrl` or `BinaryContent`. This is due to differences in how Vertex AI and Google AI handle document inputs. For more details, see [this discussion](https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/i-am-using-google-generative-ai-model-gemini-1-5-pro-for-image-analysis-but-getting-error/34866/4). If you are unsatisfied with this behavior, please let us know by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues). You can provide document input using either [`DocumentUrl`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.DocumentUrl) or [`BinaryContent`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.BinaryContent). The process is similar to the examples above. If you have a direct URL for the document, you can use [`DocumentUrl`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.DocumentUrl): main.py

Debugging and Monitoring Applications that use LLMs have some challenges that are well known and understood: LLMs are **slow** , **unreliable** and **expensive**. These applications also have some challenges that most developers have encountered much less often: LLMs are **fickle** and **non-deterministic**. Subtle changes in a prompt can completely change a model's performance, and there's no `EXPLAIN` query you can run to understand why. Warning From a software engineers point of view, you can think of LLMs as the worst database you've ever heard of, but worse. If LLMs weren't so bloody useful, we'd never touch them. To build successful applications with LLMs, we need new tools to understand both model performance, and the behavior of applications that rely on them. LLM Observability tools that just let you understand how your model is performing are useless: making API calls to an LLM is easy, it's building that into an application that's hard. Pydantic Logfire [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) is an observability platform developed by the team who created and maintain Pydantic and PydanticAI. Logfire aims to let you understand your entire application: Gen AI, classic predictive AI, HTTP traffic, database queries and everything else a modern application needs. Pydantic Logfire is a commercial product Logfire is a commercially supported, hosted platform with an extremely generous and perpetual [free tier](https://pydantic.dev/pricing/). You can sign up and start using Logfire in a couple of minutes. PydanticAI has built-in (but optional) support for Logfire. That means if the `logfire` package is installed and configured and agent instrumentation is enabled then detailed information about agent runs is sent to Logfire. Otherwise there's virtually no overhead and nothing is sent. Here's an example showing details of running the [Weather Agent](../examples/weather-agent/) in Logfire: [![Weather Agent Logfire](../img/logfire-weather-agent.png)](../img/logfire-weather-agent.png) Using Logfire To use logfire, you'll need a logfire [account](https://logfire.pydantic.dev), and logfire installed: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai[logfire]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai[logfire]"
                        

Then authenticate your local environment with logfire: pipuv
                        
                                                 logfire auth
                        
                        
                                                uv run logfire auth
                        

And configure a project to send data to: pipuv
                        
                                                 logfire projects new
                        
                        
                                                uv run logfire projects new
                        

(Or use an existing project with `logfire projects use`) Then add logfire to your code: adding_logfire.py
                        
                                                import logfire
                        
                        logfire.configure()
                        

and enable instrumentation in your agent: instrument_agent.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', instrument=True)

including instrumentation for libraries like Pydantic, HTTPX, and FastAPI. Built on OpenTelemetry, the Logfire Python SDK facilitates data transmission to OpenTelemetry collectors. It aids application understanding through real-time debugging and SQL-based monitoring dashboards.', 'The [logfire documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/) has more details on how to use logfire, including how to instrument other libraries like [Pydantic](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/pydantic/), [HTTPX](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/http-clients/httpx/) and [FastAPI](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/web-frameworks/fastapi/). Since Logfire is built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), you can use the Logfire Python SDK to send data to any OpenTelemetry collector. Once you have logfire set up, there are two primary ways it can help you understand your application:
              * **Debugging** â Using the live view to see what's happening in your application in real-time.
              * **Monitoring** â Using SQL and dashboards to observe the behavior of your application, Logfire is effectively a SQL database that stores information about how your application is running.
Debugging To demonstrate how Logfire can let you visualise the flow of a PydanticAI run, here's the view you get from Logfire while running the [chat app examples](../examples/chat-app/): Monitoring Performance We can also query data with SQL in Logfire to monitor the performance of an application. Here's a real world example of using Logfire to monitor PydanticAI runs inside Logfire itself: [![Logfire monitoring PydanticAI](../img/logfire-monitoring-pydanticai.png)](../img/logfire-monitoring-pydanticai.png) Monitoring HTTPX Requests In order to monitor HTTPX requests made by models, you can use `logfire`'s [HTTPX](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/http-clients/httpx/) integration. Instrumentation is as easy as adding the following three lines to your application: instrument_httpx.py
                        
                                                import logfire
                        logfire.configure()
                        logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)  # (1)!
                        

              1. See the [logfire docs](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/http-clients/httpx/) for more `httpx` instrumentation details.
In particular, this can help you to trace specific requests, responses, and headers: instrument_httpx_example.py

With `httpx` instrumentationWithout `httpx` instrumentation [![Logfire with HTTPX instrumentation](../img/logfire-with-httpx.png)](../img/logfire-with-httpx.png) [![Logfire without HTTPX instrumentation](../img/logfire-without-httpx.png)](../img/logfire-without-httpx.png) Tip `httpx` instrumentation might be of particular utility if you're using a custom `httpx` client in your model in order to get insights into your custom requests. Using OpenTelemetry PydanticAI's instrumentation uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), which Logfire is based on. You can use the Logfire SDK completely freely and follow the [Alternative backends](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/alternative-backends/) guide to send the data to any OpenTelemetry collector, such as a self-hosted Jaeger instance. Or you can skip Logfire entirely and use the OpenTelemetry Python SDK directly. Data format PydanticAI follows the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), with one caveat. The semantic conventions specify that messages should be captured as individual events (logs) that are children of the request span. By default, PydanticAI instead collects these events into a JSON array which is set as a single large attribute called `events` on the request span. To change this, use [`InstrumentationSettings(event_mode='logs')`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.InstrumentationSettings). instrumentation_settings_event_mode.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.agent import InstrumentationSettings
                        
                        instrumentation_settings = InstrumentationSettings(event_mode='logs')
                        
                        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', instrument=instrumentation_settings)
                        # or instrument all agents:
                        Agent.instrument_all(instrumentation_settings)
                        

For now, this won't look as good in the Logfire UI, but we're working on it. If you have very long conversations, the `events` span attribute may be truncated. Using `event_mode='logs'` will help avoid this issue. Note that the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions are still experimental and are likely to change. Setting OpenTelemetry SDK providers By default, the global `TracerProvider` and `EventLoggerProvider` are used. These are set automatically by `logfire.configure()`. They can also be set by the `set_tracer_provider` and `set_event_logger_provider` functions in the OpenTelemetry Python SDK. You can set custom providers with [`InstrumentationSettings`](../api/models/instrumented/#pydantic_ai.models.instrumented.InstrumentationSettings). instrumentation_settings_providers.py
                        
                                                from opentelemetry.sdk._events import EventLoggerProvider
                        from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
                        
                        from pydantic_ai.agent import InstrumentationSettings
                        
                        instrumentation_settings = InstrumentationSettings(
                            tracer_provider=TracerProvider(),
                            event_logger_provider=EventLoggerProvider(),
                        )

(Requires Python 3.9+) This installs the `pydantic_ai` package, core dependencies, and libraries required to use all the models included in PydanticAI. If you want to use a specific model, you can install the "slim" version of PydanticAI. Use with Pydantic Logfire PydanticAI has an excellent (but completely optional) integration with [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) to help you view and understand agent runs. To use Logfire with PydanticAI, install `pydantic-ai` or `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `logfire` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai[logfire]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai[logfire]"
                        

From there, follow the [Logfire setup docs](../logfire/#using-logfire) to configure Logfire. Running Examples We distribute the [`pydantic_ai_examples`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples) directory as a separate PyPI package ([`pydantic-ai-examples`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-ai-examples/)) to make examples extremely easy to customize and run. To install examples, use the `examples` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai[examples]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai[examples]"
                        

To run the examples, follow instructions in the [examples docs](../examples/). Slim Install If you know which model you're going to use and want to avoid installing superfluous packages, you can use the [`pydantic-ai-slim`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-ai-slim/) package. For example, if you're using just [`OpenAIModel`](../api/models/openai/#pydantic_ai.models.openai.OpenAIModel), you would run: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"
                        

`pydantic-ai-slim` has the following optional groups:
              * `logfire` â installs [`logfire`](../logfire/) [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/logfire)
              * `openai` â installs `openai` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/openai)
              * `vertexai` â installs `google-auth` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth) and `requests` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/requests)
              * `anthropic` â installs `anthropic` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic)
              * `groq` â installs `groq` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/groq)
              * `mistral` â installs `mistralai` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/mistralai)
              * `cohere` \- installs `cohere` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/cohere)
              * `duckduckgo` \- installs `duckduckgo-search` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/duckduckgo-search)
              * `tavily` \- installs `tavily-python` [PyPI â](https://pypi.org/project/tavily-python)
See the [models](../models/) documentation for information on which optional dependencies are required for each model. You can also install dependencies for multiple models and use cases, for example: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[openai,vertexai,logfire]"

agent's run using the `result` object. The available methods from `RunResult` and `StreamedRunResult` include `all_messages()` for retrieving all messages and `all_messages_json()` for JSON format. These resources facilitate the continuation of conversations and performance understanding.', 'to messages exchanged during an agent run. These messages can be used both to continue a coherent conversation, and to understand how an agent performed. Accessing Messages from Results After running an agent, you can access the messages exchanged during that run from the `result` object. Both [`RunResult`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult) (returned by [`Agent.run`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run), [`Agent.run_sync`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_sync)) and [`StreamedRunResult`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult) (returned by [`Agent.run_stream`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream)) have the following methods:
              * [`all_messages()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.all_messages): returns all messages, including messages from prior runs. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, [`all_messages_json()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.all_messages_json).
              * [`new_messages()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.new_messages): returns only the messages from the current run. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, [`new_messages_json()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.new_messages_json).
StreamedRunResult and complete messages On [`StreamedRunResult`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult), the messages returned from these methods will only include the final result message once the stream has finished. E.g. you've awaited one of the following coroutines:
              * [`StreamedRunResult.stream()`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream)
              * [`StreamedRunResult.stream_text()`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text)
              * [`StreamedRunResult.stream_structured()`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_structured)
              * [`StreamedRunResult.get_data()`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.get_data)
**Note:** The final result message will NOT be added to result messages if you use [`.stream_text(delta=True)`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text) since in this case the result content is never built as one string.

To use existing messages in a run, pass them to the `message_history` parameter of [`Agent.run`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run), [`Agent.run_sync`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_sync) or [`Agent.run_stream`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream).

an agent's run using a TypeAdapter in Pydantic, particularly focusing on the `ModelMessagesTypeAdapter`. It highlights the need for persistent storage in various applications and provides a code example for serializing messages to JSON.', '_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Storing and loading messages (to JSON) While maintaining conversation state in memory is enough for many applications, often times you may want to store the messages history of an agent run on disk or in a database. This might be for evals, for sharing data between Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, or any number of other use cases. The intended way to do this is using a `TypeAdapter`. We export [`ModelMessagesTypeAdapter`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ModelMessagesTypeAdapter) that can be used for this, or you can create your own. Here's an example showing how: serialize messages to json
                        
                                                from pydantic_core import to_jsonable_python
                        
                        from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessagesTypeAdapter  # (1)!
                        
                        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')
                        
                        result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
                        history_step_1 = result1.all_messages()
                        as_python_objects = to_jsonable_python(history_step_1)  # (2)!
                        same_history_as_step_1 = ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_python(as_python_objects)
                        
                        result2 = agent.run_sync(  # (3)!
                            'Tell me a different joke.', message_history=same_history_as_step_1
                        )
                        

              1. Alternatively, you can create a `TypeAdapter` from scratch: 
                            
                                                        from pydantic import TypeAdapter
                            from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage
                            ModelMessagesTypeAdapter = TypeAdapter(list[ModelMessage])
                            

              2. Alternatively you can serialize to/from JSON directly: 
                            
                                                        from pydantic_core import to_json
                            ...
                            as_json_objects = to_json(history_step_1)

history even when a new agent run is initiated. Messages are represented by dataclasses, allowing for easy creation and manipulation across different models. This allows messages from one agent run to be reused in another run with different models.', '3. You can now continue the conversation with history `same_history_as_step_1` despite creating a new agent run.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Other ways of using messages Since messages are defined by simple dataclasses, you can manually create and manipulate, e.g. for testing. The message format is independent of the model used, so you can use messages in different agents, or the same agent with different models. In the example below, we reuse the message from the first agent run, which uses the `openai:gpt-4o` model, in a second agent run using the `google-gla:gemini-1.5-pro` model.

Models PydanticAI is Model-agnostic and has built in support for the following model providers:
              * OpenAI
              * Anthropic
              * Gemini via two different APIs: Generative Language API and VertexAI API
              * Ollama
              * Groq
              * Mistral
              * Cohere
              * Bedrock
See OpenAI-compatible models for more examples on how to use models such as OpenRouter, and Grok (xAI) that support the OpenAI SDK. You can also add support for other models. PydanticAI also comes with [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/) and [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/) for testing and development. To use each model provider, you need to configure your local environment and make sure you have the right packages installed. Models, Interfaces, and Providers PydanticAI uses a few key terms to describe how it interacts with different LLMs:
              * **Model** : This refers to the specific LLM model you want to handle your requests (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `gemini-1.5-flash`). It's the "brain" that processes your prompts and generates responses. You specify the _Model_ as a parameter to the _Interface_.

vendor-SDK-agnostic API that allows a single agent to switch between different LLM vendors by changing the interface it uses. It introduces the current naming convention for interface classes and the upcoming renaming to better reflect their purpose. Additionally, it explains the role of the Provider in handling authentication and connections specific to LLM vendors.', 'These classes implement a vendor-SDK-agnostic API, ensuring a single PydanticAI agent is portable to different LLM vendors without any other code changes just by swapping out the _Interface_ it uses. Currently, interface classes are named roughly in the format `<VendorSdk>Model`, for example, we have `OpenAIModel`, `AnthropicModel`, `GeminiModel`, etc. These `Model` classes will soon be renamed to `<VendorSdk>Interface` to reflect this terminology better.
              * **Provider** : This refers to _Interface_ -specific classes which handle the authentication and connections to an LLM vendor. Passing a non-default _Provider_ as a parameter to an _Interface_ is how you can ensure that your agent will make requests to a specific endpoint, or make use of a specific approach to authentication (e.g., you can use Vertex-specific auth with the `GeminiModel` by way of the `VertexProvider`). In particular, this is how you can make use of an AI gateway, or an LLM vendor that offers API compatibility with the vendor SDK used by an existing interface (such as `OpenAIModel`).
In short, you select a _model_ , PydanticAI uses the appropriate _interface_ class, and the _provider_ handles the connection and authentication to the underlying service. OpenAI Install To use OpenAI models, you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `openai` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"
                        

Configuration To use [`OpenAIModel`](../api/models/openai/#pydantic_ai.models.openai.OpenAIModel) through their main API, go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key. Environment variable Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
                        
                                                export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
                        

You can then use [`OpenAIModel`](../api/models/openai/#pydantic_ai.models.openai.OpenAIModel) by name: openai_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
                        ...
                        

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name: openai_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
                        
                        model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

By default, the `OpenAIModel` uses the [`OpenAIProvider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.openai.OpenAIProvider.__init__) with the `base_url` set to `https://api.openai.com/v1`. `provider` argument You can provide a custom [`Provider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.Provider) via the [`provider` argument](../api/models/openai/#pydantic_ai.models.openai.OpenAIModel.__init__): openai_model_provider.py

Anthropic Install To use [`AnthropicModel`](../api/models/anthropic/#pydantic_ai.models.anthropic.AnthropicModel) models, you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `anthropic` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic]"
                        

Configuration To use [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com) through their API, go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) to generate an API key. [`AnthropicModelName`](../api/models/anthropic/#pydantic_ai.models.anthropic.AnthropicModelName) contains a list of available Anthropic models. Environment variable Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
                        
                                                export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'
                        

You can then use [`AnthropicModel`](../api/models/anthropic/#pydantic_ai.models.anthropic.AnthropicModel) by name: anthropic_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
                        ...
                        

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name: anthropic_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
                        
                        model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')

                        ...
                        

`provider` argument You can provide a custom [`Provider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.Provider) via the [`provider` argument](../api/models/anthropic/#pydantic_ai.models.anthropic.AnthropicModel.__init__): anthropic_model_provider.py

Gemini Install To use [`GeminiModel`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel) models, you just need to install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/) or [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install), no extra dependencies are required. Configuration [`GeminiModel`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel) let's you use the Google's Gemini models through their [Generative Language API](https://ai.google.dev/api/all-methods), `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`. [`GeminiModelName`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModelName) contains a list of available Gemini models that can be used through this interface. To use `GeminiModel`, go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and select "Create API key". Environment variable Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
                        
                                                export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
                        

You can then use [`GeminiModel`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel) by name: gemini_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('google-gla:gemini-2.0-flash')
                        ...
                        

Note The `google-gla` provider prefix represents the [Google **G** enerative **L** anguage **A** PI](https://ai.google.dev/api/all-methods) for `GeminiModel`s. `google-vertex` is used with [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models). Or initialise the model directly with just the model name and provider: gemini_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent

                        model = GeminiModel('gemini-2.0-flash', provider='google-gla')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

`provider` argument You can provide a custom [`Provider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.Provider) via the [`provider` argument](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel.__init__): gemini_model_provider.py

accessing the `*-aiplatform.googleapis.com` API. To implement this, installations of either `pydantic-ai` or `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `vertexai` optional group are required. The document also mentions `GeminiModelName`, which provides a list of available Gemini models.', 'Gemini via VertexAI If you are an enterprise user, you should use the `google-vertex` provider with [`GeminiModel`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel) which uses the `*-aiplatform.googleapis.com` API. [`GeminiModelName`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModelName) contains a list of available Gemini models that can be used through this interface. Install To use the `google-vertex` provider with [`GeminiModel`](../api/models/gemini/#pydantic_ai.models.gemini.GeminiModel), you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `vertexai` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[vertexai]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[vertexai]"
                        

Configuration This interface has a number of advantages over `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` documented above:
              1. The VertexAI API comes with more enterprise readiness guarantees.
              2. You can [purchase provisioned throughput](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/provisioned-throughput#purchase-provisioned-throughput) with VertexAI to guarantee capacity.
              3. If you're running PydanticAI inside GCP, you don't need to set up authentication, it should "just work".
              4. You can decide which region to use, which might be important from a regulatory perspective, and might improve latency.
The big disadvantage is that for local development you may need to create and configure a "service account", which I've found extremely painful to get right in the past. Whichever way you authenticate, you'll need to have VertexAI enabled in your GCP account. Application default credentials Luckily if you're running PydanticAI inside GCP, or you have the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) installed and configured, you should be able to use `VertexAIModel` without any additional setup. To use `VertexAIModel`, with [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) configured (e.g. with `gcloud`), you can simply use: vertexai_application_default_credentials.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
                        
                        model = GeminiModel('gemini-2.0-flash', provider='google-vertex')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

Internally this uses [`google.auth.default()`](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.auth.html) from the `google-auth` package to obtain credentials. Won't fail until `agent.run()` Because `google.auth.default()` requires network requests and can be slow, it's not run until you call `agent.run()`. You may also need to pass the [`project_id` argument to `GoogleVertexProvider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex.GoogleVertexProvider) if application default credentials don't set a project, if you pass `project_id` and it conflicts with the project set by application default credentials, an error is raised. Service account If instead of application default credentials, you want to authenticate with a service account, you'll need to create a service account, add it to your GCP project (note: AFAIK this step is necessary even if you created the service account within the project), give that service account the "Vertex AI Service Agent" role, and download the service account JSON file. Once you have the JSON file, you can use it thus: vertexai_service_account.py

Customising region Whichever way you authenticate, you can specify which region requests will be sent to via the [`region` argument](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex.GoogleVertexProvider). Using a region close to your application can improve latency and might be important from a regulatory perspective. vertexai_region.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
                        from pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex import GoogleVertexProvider
                        
                        model = GeminiModel(
                            'gemini-2.0-flash', provider=GoogleVertexProvider(region='asia-east1')
                        )
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

You can also customize the `GoogleVertexProvider` with a custom `http_client`: vertexai_custom_provider.py
                        
                                                from httpx import AsyncClient
                        
                        from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
                        from pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex import GoogleVertexProvider
                        
                        custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
                        model = GeminiModel(
                            'gemini-2.0-flash',
                            provider=GoogleVertexProvider(region='asia-east1', http_client=custom_http_client),
                        )
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

Groq Install To use [`GroqModel`](../api/models/groq/#pydantic_ai.models.groq.GroqModel), you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `groq` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[groq]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[groq]"
                        

Configuration To use [Groq](https://groq.com/) through their API, go to [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key. [`GroqModelName`](../api/models/groq/#pydantic_ai.models.groq.GroqModelName) contains a list of available Groq models. Environment variable Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
                        
                                                export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key'
                        

You can then use [`GroqModel`](../api/models/groq/#pydantic_ai.models.groq.GroqModel) by name: groq_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('groq:llama-3.3-70b-versatile')
                        ...
                        

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name: groq_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.groq import GroqModel
                        
                        model = GroqModel('llama-3.3-70b-versatile')

                        ...
                        

You can also customize the [`GroqProvider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.groq.GroqProvider) with a custom `httpx.AsyncHTTPClient`: groq_model_custom_provider.py

Mistral Install To use [`MistralModel`](../api/models/mistral/#pydantic_ai.models.mistral.MistralModel), you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `mistral` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[mistral]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[mistral]"
                        

Configuration To use [Mistral](https://mistral.ai) through their API, go to [console.mistral.ai/api-keys/](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key. [`LatestMistralModelNames`](../api/models/mistral/#pydantic_ai.models.mistral.LatestMistralModelNames) contains a list of the most popular Mistral models. Environment variable Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
                        
                                                export MISTRAL_API_KEY='your-api-key'
                        

You can then use [`MistralModel`](../api/models/mistral/#pydantic_ai.models.mistral.MistralModel) by name: mistral_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('mistral:mistral-large-latest')
                        ...
                        

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name: mistral_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.mistral import MistralModel
                        
                        model = MistralModel('mistral-small-latest')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

`provider` argument You can provide a custom [`Provider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.Provider) via the [`provider` argument](../api/models/mistral/#pydantic_ai.models.mistral.MistralModel.__init__): groq_model_provider.py

Cohere Install To use [`CohereModel`](../api/models/cohere/#pydantic_ai.models.cohere.CohereModel), you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `cohere` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[cohere]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[cohere]"
                        

Configuration To use [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) through their API, go to [dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key. [`CohereModelName`](../api/models/cohere/#pydantic_ai.models.cohere.CohereModelName) contains a list of the most popular Cohere models. Environment variable Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:
                        
                                                export CO_API_KEY='your-api-key'
                        

You can then use [`CohereModel`](../api/models/cohere/#pydantic_ai.models.cohere.CohereModel) by name: cohere_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('cohere:command')
                        ...
                        

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name: cohere_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.cohere import CohereModel
                        
                        model = CohereModel('command', api_key='your-api-key')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

`api_key` argument If you don't want to or can't set the environment variable, you can pass it at runtime via the [`api_key` argument](../api/models/cohere/#pydantic_ai.models.cohere.CohereModel.__init__): cohere_model_api_key.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        from pydantic_ai.models.cohere import CohereModel
                        
                        model = CohereModel('command', api_key='your-api-key')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

Bedrock Install To use [`BedrockConverseModel`](../api/models/bedrock/#pydantic_ai.models.bedrock.BedrockConverseModel), you need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install/), or install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `bedrock` optional group: pipuv
                        
                                                pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[bedrock]"
                        
                        
                                                uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[bedrock]"
                        

Configuration To use [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), you'll need an AWS account with Bedrock enabled and appropriate credentials. You can use either AWS credentials directly or a pre-configured boto3 client. [`BedrockModelName`](../api/models/bedrock/#pydantic_ai.models.bedrock.BedrockModelName) contains a list of available Bedrock models, including models from Anthropic, Amazon, Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. Environment variables You can set your AWS credentials as environment variables:
                        
                                                export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key'

AI. It provides two methods: using the model by name with the `Agent` class, and directly initializing the model. Additionally, it mentions the option to provide a custom `BedrockProvider`.', 'You can then use [`BedrockConverseModel`](../api/models/bedrock/#pydantic_ai.models.bedrock.BedrockConverseModel) by name: bedrock_model_by_name.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent

                        ...
                        

Or initialize the model directly with just the model name: bedrock_model_init.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent

                        model = BedrockConverseModel('anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0')
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

`provider` argument You can provide a custom [`BedrockProvider`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock.BedrockProvider) via the [`provider` argument](../api/models/bedrock/#pydantic_ai.models.bedrock.BedrockConverseModel.__init__). This is useful when you want to specify credentials directly or use a custom boto3 client: bedrock_model_provider.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent

                        # Using AWS credentials directly
                        model = BedrockConverseModel(
                            'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
                            provider=BedrockProvider(
                                region_name='us-east-1',
                                aws_access_key_id='your-access-key',
                                aws_secret_access_key='your-secret-key',
                            ),
                        )
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

You can also pass a pre-configured boto3 client: bedrock_model_boto3.py
                        
                                                import boto3

                        from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider
                        
                        # Using a pre-configured boto3 client
                        bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')
                        model = BedrockConverseModel(
                            'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
                            provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client),
                        )
                        agent = Agent(model)
                        ...
                        

OpenAI-compatible Models Many of the models are compatible with OpenAI API, and thus can be used with [`OpenAIModel`](../api/models/openai/#pydantic_ai.models.openai.OpenAIModel) in PydanticAI. Before getting started, check the OpenAI section for installation and configuration instructions. To use another OpenAI-compatible API, you can make use of the [`base_url`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.openai.OpenAIProvider.__init__) and [`api_key`](../api/providers/#pydantic_ai.providers.openai.OpenAIProvider.__init__) arguments from `OpenAIProvider`: deepseek_model_init.py

Ollama To use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you must first download the Ollama client, and then download a model using the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library). You must also ensure the Ollama server is running when trying to make requests to it. For more information, please see the [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs). Example local usage With `ollama` installed, you can run the server with the model you want to use: terminal-run-ollama

class and, for streaming support, also implement the StreamedResponse class. Review existing models like OpenAIModel for guidance. Use FallbackModel to attempt multiple models in sequence until a successful result is achieved.', 'Implementing Custom Models To implement support for models not already supported, you will need to subclass the [`Model`](../api/models/base/#pydantic_ai.models.Model) abstract base class. For streaming, you'll also need to implement the following abstract base class:
              * [`StreamedResponse`](../api/models/base/#pydantic_ai.models.StreamedResponse)
The best place to start is to review the source code for existing implementations, e.g. [`OpenAIModel`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/openai.py). For details on when we'll accept contributions adding new models to PydanticAI, see the [contributing guidelines](../contributing/#new-model-rules). Fallback You can use [`FallbackModel`](../api/models/fallback/#pydantic_ai.models.fallback.FallbackModel) to attempt multiple models in sequence until one returns a successful result. Under the hood, PydanticAI automatically switches from one model to the next if the current model returns a 4xx or 5xx status code. In the following example, the agent first makes a request to the OpenAI model (which fails due to an invalid API key), and then falls back to the Anthropic model. fallback_model.py

The `ModelResponse` message above indicates in the `model_name` field that the result was returned by the Anthropic model, which is the second model specified in the `FallbackModel`. Note Each model's options should be configured individually. For example, `base_url`, `api_key`, and custom clients should be set on each model itself, not on the `FallbackModel`. In this next example, we demonstrate the exception-handling capabilities of `FallbackModel`. If all models fail, a [`FallbackExceptionGroup`](../api/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.FallbackExceptionGroup) is raised, which contains all the exceptions encountered during the `run` execution.

By default, the `FallbackModel` only moves on to the next model if the current model raises a [`ModelHTTPError`](../api/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError).

applications using `pydantic_ai`, including single agent workflows, agent delegation, programmatic agent hand-off, and graph-based control flow. It emphasizes the potential to combine different strategies and explains agent delegation, where one agent can delegate tasks to another and regain control afterward.', 'Single agent workflows â what most of the `pydantic_ai` documentation covers
              2. Agent delegation â agents using another agent via tools
              3. Programmatic agent hand-off â one agent runs, then application code calls another agent
              4. [Graph based control flow](../graph/) â for the most complex cases, a graph-based state machine can be used to control the execution of multiple agents
Of course, you can combine multiple strategies in a single application. Agent delegation "Agent delegation" refers to the scenario where an agent delegates work to another agent, then takes back control when the delegate agent (the agent called from within a tool) finishes. Since agents are stateless and designed to be global, you do not need to include the agent itself in agent [dependencies](../dependencies/). You'll generally want to pass [`ctx.usage`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.usage) to the [`usage`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run) keyword argument of the delegate agent run so usage within that run counts towards the total usage of the parent agent run. Multiple models Agent delegation doesn't need to use the same model for each agent. If you choose to use different models within a run, calculating the monetary cost from the final [`result.usage()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.usage) of the run will not be possible, but you can still use [`UsageLimits`](../api/usage/#pydantic_ai.usage.UsageLimits) to avoid unexpected costs. agent_delegation_simple.py

initialization and management of dependencies in agent delegation, emphasizing that delegate agents should generally share the same or a subset of dependencies as the calling agent. It warns against initializing new dependencies within tool calls due to potential performance issues and inefficiencies.', 'Agent delegation and dependencies Generally the delegate agent needs to either have the same [dependencies](../dependencies/) as the calling agent, or dependencies which are a subset of the calling agent's dependencies. Initializing dependencies We say "generally" above since there's nothing to stop you initializing dependencies within a tool call and therefore using interdependencies in a delegate agent that are not available on the parent, this should often be avoided since it can be significantly slower than reusing connections etc. from the parent agent. agent_delegation_deps.py

set up multi-agent applications using dataclasses for client and API key dependencies. It details the configuration of two agents, `joke_selection_agent` and `joke_generation_agent`, including passing dependencies and defining tools for HTTP requests. The example demonstrates a complete workflow with multi-layered requests, illustrating the complexity of agent delegation.', '1. Define a dataclass to hold the client and API key dependencies.
              2. Set the `deps_type` of the calling agent â `joke_selection_agent` here.
              3. Pass the dependencies to the delegate agent's run method within the tool call.
              4. Also set the `deps_type` of the delegate agent â `joke_generation_agent` here.
              5. Define a tool on the delegate agent that uses the dependencies to make an HTTP request.
              6. Usage now includes 4 requests â 2 from the calling agent and 2 from the delegate agent.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ This example shows how even a fairly simple agent delegation can lead to a complex control flow:

              1. Define the first agent, which finds a flight. We use an explicit type annotation until [PEP-747](https://peps.python.org/pep-0747/) lands, see [structured results](../results/#structured-result-validation). We use a union as the result type so the model can communicate if it's unable to find a satisfactory choice; internally, each member of the union will be registered as a separate tool.
              2. Define a tool on the agent to find a flight. In this simple case we could dispense with the tool and just define the agent to return structured data, then search for a flight, but in more complex scenarios the tool would be necessary.
              3. Define usage limits for the entire app.
              4. Define a function to find a flight, which asks the user for their preferences and then calls the agent to find a flight.
              5. As with `flight_search_agent` above, we use an explicit type annotation to define the agent.
              6. Define a function to find the user's seat preference, which asks the user for their seat preference and then calls the agent to extract the seat preference.
              7. Now that we've put our logic for running each agent into separate functions, our main app becomes very simple.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ The control flow for this example can be summarised as follows:

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Runs end when either a plain text response is received or the model calls a tool associated with one of the structured result types. We will add limits to make sure a run doesn't go on indefinitely, see [#70](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/70). Result data When the result type is `str`, or a union including `str`, plain text responses are enabled on the model, and the raw text response from the model is used as the response data. If the result type is a union with multiple members (after remove `str` from the members), each member is registered as a separate tool with the model in order to reduce the complexity of the tool schemas and maximise the chances a model will respond correctly. If the result type schema is not of type `"object"`, the result type is wrapped in a single element object, so the schema of all tools registered with the model are object schemas. Structured results (like tools) use Pydantic to build the JSON schema used for the tool, and to validate the data returned by the model. Bring on PEP-747 Until [PEP-747](https://peps.python.org/pep-0747/) "Annotating Type Forms" lands, unions are not valid as `type`s in Python. When creating the agent we need to `# type: ignore` the `result_type` argument, and add a type hint to tell type checkers about the type of the agent. Here's an example of returning either text or a structured value box_or_error.py

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Result validators functions Some validation is inconvenient or impossible to do in Pydantic validators, in particular when the validation requires IO and is asynchronous. PydanticAI provides a way to add validation functions via the [`agent.result_validator`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.result_validator) decorator.

dealing with streamed results in Pydantic: validating structured responses through partial validation and identifying the finality of a response during streaming. It highlights the recent addition of partial validation and describes how PydanticAI handles streaming responses to differentiate between tool calls and results.', '_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Streamed Results There two main challenges with streamed results:
              1. Validating structured responses before they're complete, this is achieved by "partial validation" which was recently added to Pydantic in [pydantic/pydantic#10748](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/10748).
              2. When receiving a response, we don't know if it's the final response without starting to stream it and peeking at the content. PydanticAI streams just enough of the response to sniff out if it's a tool call or a result, then streams the whole thing and calls tools, or returns the stream as a [`StreamedRunResult`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult).
Streaming Text Example of streamed text result: streamed_hello_world.py
                        
                                                from pydantic_ai import Agent
                        
                        agent = Agent('google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash')  # (1)!
                        
                        
                        async def main():
                            async with agent.run_stream('Where does "hello world" come from?') as result:  # (2)!
                                async for message in result.stream_text():  # (3)!
                                    print(message)
                                    #> The first known
                                    #> The first known use of "hello,
                                    #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in
                                    #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook
                                    #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C
                                    #> The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.
                        

              1. Streaming works with the standard [`Agent`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent) class, and doesn't require any special setup, just a model that supports streaming (currently all models support streaming).
              2. The [`Agent.run_stream()`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.run_stream) method is used to start a streamed run, this method returns a context manager so the connection can be closed when the stream completes.
              3. Each item yield by [`StreamedRunResult.stream_text()`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text) is the complete text response, extended as new data is received.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â you'll need to add`asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_ We can also stream text as deltas rather than the entire text in each item: streamed_delta_hello_world.py

              1. [`stream_structured`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_structured) streams the data as [`ModelResponse`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse) objects, thus iteration can't fail with a `ValidationError`.
              2. [`validate_structured_result`](../api/result/#pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.validate_structured_result) validates the data, `allow_partial=True` enables pydantic's [`experimental_allow_partial` flag on `TypeAdapter`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/type_adapter/#pydantic.type_adapter.TypeAdapter.validate_json).

unit tests for application code and evaluations (evals) for assessing the responses of language models (LLMs). It emphasizes the use of established Python testing tools like pytest for unit testing and suggests practices for efficient assertions.', '* System prompt customization 
Testing and Evals With PydanticAI and LLM integrations in general, there are two distinct kinds of test:
              1. **Unit tests** â tests of your application code, and whether it's behaving correctly
              2. **Evals** â tests of the LLM, and how good or bad its responses are
For the most part, these two kinds of tests have pretty separate goals and considerations. Unit tests Unit tests for PydanticAI code are just like unit tests for any other Python code. Because for the most part they're nothing new, we have pretty well established tools and patterns for writing and running these kinds of tests. Unless you're really sure you know better, you'll probably want to follow roughly this strategy:
              * Use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as your test harness
              * If you find yourself typing out long assertions, use [inline-snapshot](https://15r10nk.github.io/inline-snapshot/latest/)
              * Similarly, [dirty-equals](https://dirty-equals.helpmanual.io/latest/) can be useful for comparing large data structures
              * Use [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel) or [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/#pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel) in place of your actual model to avoid the usage, latency and variability of real LLM calls
              * Use [`Agent.override`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.override) to replace your model inside your application logic
              * Set [`ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS=False`](../api/models/base/#pydantic_ai.models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS) globally to block any requests from being made to non-test models accidentally
Unit testing with `TestModel` The simplest and fastest way to exercise most of your application code is using [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel), this will (by default) call all tools in the agent, then return either plain text or a structured response depending on the return type of the agent. `TestModel` is not magic The "clever" (but not too clever) part of `TestModel` is that it will attempt to generate valid structured data for [function tools](../tools/) and [result types](../results/#structured-result-validation) based on the schema of the registered tools. There's no ML or AI in `TestModel`, it's just plain old procedural Python code that tries to generate data that satisfies the JSON schema of a tool. The resulting data won't look pretty or relevant, but it should pass Pydantic's validation in most cases.

database connections and the `WeatherService` class for retrieving weather data. It highlights the importance of calling different endpoints based on date context and outlines a testing approach using `TestModel` to evaluate a function that fetches weather forecasts for user prompts without needing to mock objects or modify code.', '1. `DatabaseConn` is a class that holds a database connection
              2. `WeatherService` has methods to get weather forecasts and historic data about the weather
              3. We need to call a different endpoint depending on whether the date is in the past or the future, you'll see why this nuance is important below
              4. This function is the code we want to test, together with the agent it uses
Here we have a function that takes a list of `(user_prompt, user_id)` tuples, gets a weather forecast for each prompt, and stores the result in the database. **We want to test this code without having to mock certain objects or modify our code so we can pass test objects in.** Here's how we would write tests using [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel): test_weather_app.py

              1. We're using [anyio](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run async tests.
              2. This is a safety measure to make sure we don't accidentally make real requests to the LLM while testing, see [`ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS`](../api/models/base/#pydantic_ai.models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS) for more details.
              3. We're using [`Agent.override`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.override) to replace the agent's model with [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel), the nice thing about `override` is that we can replace the model inside agent without needing access to the agent `run*` methods call site.
              4. Now we call the function we want to test inside the `override` context manager.
              5. But default, `TestModel` will return a JSON string summarising the tools calls made, and what was returned. If you wanted to customise the response to something more closely aligned with the domain, you could add [`custom_result_text='Sunny'`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel.custom_result_text) when defining `TestModel`.
              6. So far we don't actually know which tools were called and with which values, we can use [`capture_run_messages`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.capture_run_messages) to inspect messages from the most recent run and assert the exchange between the agent and the model occurred as expected.
              7. The [`IsNow`](https://dirty-equals.helpmanual.io/latest/types/datetime/#dirty_equals.IsNow) helper allows us to use declarative asserts even with data which will contain timestamps that change over time.
              8. `TestModel` isn't doing anything clever to extract values from the prompt, so these values are hardcoded.
Unit testing with `FunctionModel` The above tests are a great start, but careful readers will notice that the `WeatherService.get_forecast` is never called since `TestModel` calls `weather_forecast` with a date in the past. To fully exercise `weather_forecast`, we need to use [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/#pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel) to customise how the tools is called. Here's an example of using `FunctionModel` to test the `weather_forecast` tool with custom inputs test_weather_app2.py

`call_weather_forecast` designed to interface with a language model during weather forecasting. The function extracts date information from user prompts while using a hard-coded location. It involves a test case where a user's query for a weather forecast is processed, and an expected result is asserted.', 'prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2032-01-01?'
                                await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)
                        
                            forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
                            assert forecast == 'The forecast is: Rainy with a chance of sun'
                        

              1. We define a function `call_weather_forecast` that will be called by `FunctionModel` in place of the LLM, this function has access to the list of [`ModelMessage`](../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ModelMessage)s that make up the run, and [`AgentInfo`](../api/models/function/#pydantic_ai.models.function.AgentInfo) which contains information about the agent and the function tools and return tools.
              2. Our function is slightly intelligent in that it tries to extract a date from the prompt, but just hard codes the location.
              3. We use [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/#pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel) to replace the agent's model with our custom function.
Overriding model via pytest fixtures If you're writing lots of tests that all require model to be overridden, you can use [pytest fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html) to override the model with [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel) or [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/#pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel) in a reusable way. Here's an example of a fixture that overrides the model with `TestModel`: tests.py

applications, differing from traditional unit tests as they do not have pass/fail outcomes but rather serve as benchmarks to track performance over time. Due to their requirement for real model execution, evals can be resource-intensive, making them unsuitable for continuous integration. Measuring performance can vary in difficulty, with some cases having straightforward metrics while others present challenges in quantification.', 'Evals "Evals" refers to evaluating a models performance for a specific application. Warning Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored. Evals are generally more like benchmarks than unit tests, they never "pass" although they do "fail"; you care mostly about how they change over time. Since evals need to be run against the real model, then can be slow and expensive to run, you generally won't want to run them in CI for every commit. Measuring performance The hardest part of evals is measuring how well the model has performed. In some cases (e.g. an agent to generate SQL) there are simple, easy to run tests that can be used to measure performance (e.g. is the SQL valid? Does it return the right results? Does it return just the right results?). In other cases (e.g. an agent that gives advice on quitting smoking) it can be very hard or impossible to make quantitative measures of performance â in the smoking case you'd really need to run a double-blind trial over months, then wait 40 years and observe health outcomes to know if changes to your prompt were an improvement. There are a few different strategies you can use to measure performance:
              * **End to end, self-contained tests** â like the SQL example, we can test the final result of the agent near-instantly
              * **Synthetic self-contained tests** â writing unit test style checks that the output is as expected, checks like `'chewing gum' in response`, while these checks might seem simplistic they can be helpful, one nice characteristic is that it's easy to tell what's wrong when they fail
              * **LLMs evaluating LLMs** â using another models, or even the same model with a different prompt to evaluate the performance of the agent (like when the class marks each other's homework because the teacher has a hangover), while the downsides and complexities of this approach are obvious, some think it can be a useful tool in the right circumstances
              * **Evals in prod** â measuring the end results of the agent in production, then creating a quantitative measure of performance, so you can easily measure changes over time as you change the prompt or model used, [logfire](../logfire/) can be extremely useful in this case since you can write a custom query to measure the performance of your agent
System prompt customization The system prompt is the developer's primary tool in controlling an agent's behavior, so it's often useful to be able to customise the system prompt and see how performance changes. This is particularly relevant when the system prompt contains a list of examples and you want to understand how changing that list affects the model's performance. Let's assume we have the following app for running SQL generated from a user prompt (this examples omits a lot of details for brevity, see the [SQL gen](../examples/sql-gen/) example for a more complete code): sql_app.py

              1. The `SqlSystemPrompt` class is used to build the system prompt, it can be customised with a list of examples and a database type. We implement this as a separate class passed as a dep to the agent so we can override both the inputs and the logic during evals via dependency injection.
              2. The `build_prompt` method constructs the system prompt from the examples and the database type.
              3. Some people think that LLMs are more likely to generate good responses if examples are formatted as XML as it's to identify the end of a string, see [#93](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/93).
              4. In reality, you would have more logic here, making it impractical to run the agent independently of the wider application.
`examples.json` looks something like this:
                        
                                                request: show me error records with the tag "foobar"
                        response: SELECT * FROM records WHERE level = 'error' and 'foobar' = ANY(tags)

effectiveness of SQL generation by an agent. It involves using the `Agent.override` method to set a custom system prompt and running application code to compare the results of generated SQL against a predefined correct output. A scoring system is established, assigning points based on the validity of the SQL and the accuracy of the results returned.', 'Now we want a way to quantify the success of the SQL generation so we can judge how changes to the agent affect its performance. We can use [`Agent.override`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.override) to replace the system prompt with a custom one that uses a subset of examples, and then run the application code (in this case `user_search`). We also run the actual SQL from the examples and compare the "correct" result from the example SQL to the SQL generated by the agent. (We compare the results of running the SQL rather than the SQL itself since the SQL might be semantically equivalent but written in a different way). To get a quantitative measure of performance, we assign points to each run as follows:
              * **-100** points if the generated SQL is invalid
              * **-1** point for each row returned by the agent (so returning lots of results is discouraged)
              * **+5** points for each row returned by the agent that matches the expected result
We use 5-fold cross-validation to judge the performance of the agent using our existing set of examples. sql_app_evals.py

them to access additional information, which is particularly useful when full context cannot be embedded in the system prompt. Unlike Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that focuses on vector search, PydanticAI tools serve a more general purpose. There are multiple methods to register these tools with an agent, including the use of the @agent.tool decorator.', 'They're useful when it is impractical or impossible to put all the context an agent might need into the system prompt, or when you want to make agents' behavior more deterministic or reliable by deferring some of the logic required to generate a response to another (not necessarily AI-powered) tool. Function tools vs. RAG Function tools are basically the "R" of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) â they augment what the model can do by letting it request extra information. The main semantic difference between PydanticAI Tools and RAG is RAG is synonymous with vector search, while PydanticAI tools are more general-purpose. (Note: we may add support for vector search functionality in the future, particularly an API for generating embeddings. See [#58](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/58)) There are a number of ways to register tools with an agent:
              * via the [`@agent.tool`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.tool) decorator â for tools that need access to the agent [context](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext)
              * via the [`@agent.tool_plain`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.tool_plain) decorator â for tools that do not need access to the agent [context](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext)
              * via the [`tools`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__) keyword argument to `Agent` which can take either plain functions, or instances of [`Tool`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.Tool)
`@agent.tool` is considered the default decorator since in the majority of cases tools will need access to the agent context. Here's an example using both: dice_game.py

numbers using the Gemini flash model. It describes how to use a player's name as a dependency and the implementation of `RunContext` to access this dependency. An example with the function `dice_result.all_messages()` is provided for running the setup.', '1. This is a pretty simple task, so we can use the fast and cheap Gemini flash model.
              2. We pass the user's name as the dependency, to keep things simple we use just the name as a string as the dependency.
              3. This tool doesn't need any context, it just returns a random number. You could probably use a dynamic system prompt in this case.
              4. This tool needs the player's name, so it uses `RunContext` to access dependencies which are just the player's name in this case.
              5. Run the agent, passing the player's name as the dependency.

Registering Function Tools via kwarg As well as using the decorators, we can register tools via the `tools` argument to the [`Agent` constructor](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__). This is useful when you want to reuse tools, and can also give more fine-grained control over the tools. dice_game_tool_kwarg.py

a list of functions, emphasizing the inspection of function signatures for compatibility with `RunContext`. It also discusses the use of `Tool` for reusing tool definitions and providing detailed control over tool attributes such as name and description. Additionally, the documentation highlights the difference between function tools and structured results, detailing how function tools facilitate model interactions and schema definitions for responses.', '1. The simplest way to register tools via the `Agent` constructor is to pass a list of functions, the function signature is inspected to determine if the tool takes [`RunContext`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext).
              2. `agent_a` and `agent_b` are identical â but we can use [`Tool`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.Tool) to reuse tool definitions and give more fine-grained control over how tools are defined, e.g. setting their name or description, or using a custom `prepare` method.
_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Function Tools vs. Structured Results As the name suggests, function tools use the model's "tools" or "functions" API to let the model know what is available to call. Tools or functions are also used to define the schema(s) for structured responses, thus a model might have access to many tools, some of which call function tools while others end the run and return a result. Function tools and schema Function parameters are extracted from the function signature, and all parameters except `RunContext` are used to build the schema for that tool call. Even better, PydanticAI extracts the docstring from functions and (thanks to [griffe](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/)) extracts parameter descriptions from the docstring and adds them to the schema. [Griffe supports](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/reference/docstrings/#docstrings) extracting parameter descriptions from `google`, `numpy`, and `sphinx` style docstrings. PydanticAI will infer the format to use based on the docstring, but you can explicitly set it using [`docstring_format`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.DocstringFormat). You can also enforce parameter requirements by setting `require_parameter_descriptions=True`. This will raise a [`UserError`](../api/exceptions/#pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError) if a parameter description is missing. To demonstrate a tool's schema, here we use [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/#pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel) to print the schema a model would receive: tool_schema.py

JSON. It outlines how different models accept various return formats, such as semi-structured values or strings, and details the simplification of tool schemas when using parameters represented as objects in JSON schema.', '_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ The return type of tool can be anything which Pydantic can serialize to JSON as some models (e.g. Gemini) support semi-structured return values, some expect text (OpenAI) but seem to be just as good at extracting meaning from the data. If a Python object is returned and the model expects a string, the value will be serialized to JSON. If a tool has a single parameter that can be represented as an object in JSON schema (e.g. dataclass, TypedDict, pydantic model), the schema for the tool is simplified to be just that object. Here's an example where we use [`TestModel.last_model_request_parameters`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel.last_model_request_parameters) to inspect the tool schema that would be passed to the model. single_parameter_tool.py

`prepare` function. The `prepare` method can be registered via various decorators or the Tool dataclass, and is used to customize the tool's definition during a run, allowing for modifications or complete omission of the tool.', '_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_ Dynamic Function tools Tools can optionally be defined with another function: `prepare`, which is called at each step of a run to customize the definition of the tool passed to the model, or omit the tool completely from that step. A `prepare` method can be registered via the `prepare` kwarg to any of the tool registration mechanisms:
              * [`@agent.tool`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.tool) decorator
              * [`@agent.tool_plain`](../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.tool_plain) decorator
              * [`Tool`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.Tool) dataclass
The `prepare` method, should be of type [`ToolPrepareFunc`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.ToolPrepareFunc), a function which takes [`RunContext`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext) and a pre-built [`ToolDefinition`](../api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.ToolDefinition), and should either return that `ToolDefinition` with or without modifying it, return a new `ToolDefinition`, or return `None` to indicate this tools should not be registered for that step. Here's a simple `prepare` method that only includes the tool if the value of the dependency is `42`. As with the previous example, we use [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/#pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel) to demonstrate the behavior without calling a real model. tool_only_if_42.py

PydanticAI, including managing event loop conflicts in Jupyter notebooks with 'nest-asyncio'. It also suggests reaching out via Slack or GitHub for unresolved issues.', '* Monitoring HTTPX Requests 
Troubleshooting Below are suggestions on how to fix some common errors you might encounter while using PydanticAI. If the issue you're experiencing is not listed below or addressed in the documentation, please feel free to ask in the [Pydantic Slack](../help/) or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues). Jupyter Notebook Errors `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running` This error is caused by conflicts between the event loops in Jupyter notebook and PydanticAI's. One way to manage these conflicts is by using [`nest-asyncio`](https://pypi.org/project/nest-asyncio/). Namely, before you execute any agent runs, do the following: 
                        
                                                import nest_asyncio
                        
                        nest_asyncio.apply()
                        

Note: This fix also applies to Google Colab. API Key Configuration `UserError: API key must be provided or set in the [MODEL]_API_KEY environment variable` If you're running into issues with setting the API key for your model, visit the [Models](../models/) page to learn more about how to set an environment variable and/or pass in an `api_key` argument. Monitoring HTTPX Requests You can use custom `httpx` clients in your models in order to access specific requests, responses, and headers at runtime.

`pydantic_ai.agent` Agent `dataclass` Bases: `[Generic](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic "typing.Generic")[[AgentDepsT](../tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.AgentDepsT "pydantic_ai.tools.AgentDepsT"), [ResultDataT](../result/#pydantic_ai.result.ResultDataT "pydantic_ai.result.ResultDataT")]` Class for defining "agents" - a way to have a specific type of "conversation" with an LLM. Agents are generic in the dependency type they take [`AgentDepsT`](../tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.AgentDepsT) and the result data type they return, [`ResultDataT`](../result/#pydantic_ai.result.ResultDataT). By default, if neither generic parameter is customised, agents have type `Agent[None, str]`. Minimal usage example:
