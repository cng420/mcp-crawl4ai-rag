## Setup guide[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#setupguide)
In your primary database, you need to do the following:
  * Allow access to your PostgreSQL database using [Fivetran's IP](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/ips)
  * Create a Fivetran-specific PostgreSQL user with read-level permissions
  * (Optional) Allow access to a read-replica of your PostgreSQL database. Using a read-replica can help to avoid unnecessary strain on your primary database.
  * (Logical replication Only) Allow access to a logical replication slot


For specific instructions on how to set up your database, see the guide for your PostgreSQL database type:

## Sync overview[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#syncoverview)
Once Fivetran is connected to your PostgreSQL database or read replica, we pull a full dump of all selected data from your database. Using either the Fivetran Teleport Sync, logical replication, or XMIN change data capture process, we pull all your new and changed data at regular intervals.
If data in the source changes (for example, you add new tables or change a data type), Fivetran automatically detects and persists these changes into your destination. For every schema in your PostgreSQL source database, we create a schema in your destination that maps directly to its native schema. This ensures that the data in your destination is in a familiar format to work with.
### Syncing empty tables and columns[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#syncingemptytablesandcolumns)
Fivetran will sync empty tables and columns for your PostgreSQL connection. We only sync empty columns to your destination once you make another data alteration to that table. Simply adding a new column will _not_ be reflected in your destination. For more information, see our [Features documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/features#syncingemptytablesandcolumns).
## Schema information[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#schemainformation)
Fivetran tries to replicate the exact schema and tables from your database to your destination. We name the source schema with the database schema name and replicate the source's tables to the destination schema.
> NOTE: We do not sync foreign tables, views, or materialized views.
We name the destination schema with the connection name appended by the database schema name converted as per our [schema naming rules](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts#schemanamingruleset). For example, if the connection name is `postgres_db` and the database schema name is `fivetran_schema`, the destination schema name is `postgres_db_fivetran_schema`.
Fivetran allows you to control how source names for tables and columns are replicated to the destination. You can choose between preserving the original source names with UTF-8 values or standardizing the naming conventions for schemas, tables, and columns in the destination.
  * To standardize the naming conventions in the destination, select **Fivetran naming**.

type transformations, and support for PostgreSQL data types during initial setup and data synchronization.
---
You can modify this selection at any time before the initial sync completes, offering flexibility in how your data is structured in the destination. For more information, see our [naming conventions documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts#namingconventions).
### Fivetran-generated columns[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#fivetrangeneratedcolumns)
Fivetran adds the following columns to every table that is added to your destination:
  * `_fivetran_synced` (UTC TIMESTAMP) indicates the time when Fivetran last successfully synced the row.
  * `_fivetran_id` (STRING) is the hash of the non-Fivetran values of each row. It's a unique ID that Fivetran uses to identify rows in tables that do not have a primary key.
  * `_fivetran_deleted` (BOOLEAN) marks rows that were deleted in the source database.
> NOTE: If you use XMIN as your incremental sync method, your `_fivetran_deleted` column will have null values because XMIN does not track deleted rows.


We add these columns to give you insight into the state of your data and the progress of your data syncs. For more information about these columns, see [our System Columns and Tables documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts/system-columns-and-tables).
### Type transformation and mapping[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#typetransformationandmapping)
As we extract your data, we match PostgreSQL data types to types that Fivetran supports. If we don't support a certain data type, we automatically change that type to the closest supported type or, in some cases, don't load that data at all. Our system automatically skips columns of data types that we don't accept or transform.
For primary keys, all supported data types are valid.
The following table illustrates how we transform your PostgreSQL data types into Fivetran supported types:

```

## Initial sync[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#initialsync)
When Fivetran connects to a new database, we first copy all rows from every table in every schema for which we have SELECT permissions (except for those that you excluded on your Fivetran dashboard) and add [Fivetran-generated columns](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#fivetrangeneratedcolumns). We copy the tables in ascending size order (from smallest to largest). We copy rows by performing a SELECT statement on each table. For large tables, we copy a limited number of rows at a time so that we don't have to start the sync over from the beginning if the connection to your source is lost midway.
## Updating data[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#updatingdata)
Fivetran performs incremental updates of any new or modified data from your source database. We use one of the following methods to perform incremental updates:
  * [Logical replication](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logicalreplication)
  * [XMIN system column](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xminsystemcolumn)
  * [Fivetran Teleport Sync](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#fivetranteleportsync)


### Logical replication vs XMIN vs Fivetran Teleport Sync[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logicalreplicationvsxminvsfivetranteleportsync)
We recommend using logical replication as the incremental sync method if you have a high-volume transactional database. Logical replication minimizes processing overhead on your PostgreSQL server and supports key features like replicating row deletions for tables with primary keys.
There are several key differences between logical replication, XMIN, and Fivetran Teleport Sync:
Feature| Logical replication| XMIN| Fivetran Teleport Sync  
---|---|---|---  
Syncs tables with primary keys| Yes| Yes| Partially1  
Syncs tables without primary keys| Yes| Yes| No  
Can read from a replica| Yes2| Yes| Yes  
Tracks DDL changes| Partially3| Partially3| Partially3  
Tracks DML changes| Yes| Partially| Yes  
Tracks deletes| Yes| No| Yes  
Tracks inserts and updates| Yes| Yes| Yes  
Provides full record of changed data| Yes| Yes4| Yes  
Replicates partitioned tables5| Yes6| Yes| Yes  
Replicates [generated columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html)| No| Yes| Yes  
1Learn which primary keys Fivetran Teleport Sync supports in the Teleport [Limitations documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#limitations).
2 Logical replication supports reading from a replica for PostgreSQL version 16 or later.
3 Learn more in our [Support for DDL changes documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#supportforddlchanges).
4 The following actions can cause the XMIN values of a row to change and entire tables to be marked as new, resulting in increased MAR: - Using tools like `pg_repack`, `pg_dump`, and `pg_restore` - Truncating and repopulating tables
5 We do not support the [TimescaleDB extension](https://docs.timescale.com/).
6 Logical replication supports replicating partitioned tables for PostgreSQL version 13 or later.
### Logical replication[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logicalreplication)
Logical replication is based on [logical decoding](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding.html) of the PostgreSQL write-ahead log (WAL). We recommend this method for incremental updates because it:
  * Minimizes processing overhead on your PostgreSQL server
  * Replicates row deletions for tables with primary keys', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#solution", "source": "fivetran.com", "headers": "## Setup

# PostgreSQL[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#postgresql)
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open-source database. Fivetran's integration platform replicates data from your PostgreSQL source database and loads it into your destination.
> NOTE: Fivetran supports PostgreSQL as both a [database connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql) and a [destination](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/postgresql).
Fivetran offers the following solutions for replicating data from your PostgreSQL source database:
  * Fivetran native connector
  * [HVR](https://fivetran.com/docs/hvr6) - [PostgreSQL](https://fivetran.com/docs/hvr6/requirements/source-and-target-requirements/postgresql-requirements)


This document is about the Fivetran's native connector for PostgreSQL.

incremental data synchronization in Fivetran, including its limitations, performance considerations, and the Fivetran Teleport Sync method that leverages `xmin` for efficient updates and deletions.
---
tem column[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xminsystemcolumn)
The hidden PostgreSQL system column `xmin` can be used to select only the new or changed rows since the last update. The XMIN method has the following disadvantages:
  * **Cannot replicate row deletions** : There is no way to tell which rows in the destination are no longer present in the source database. XMIN can't track row deletions because it relies on a hidden system column in PostgreSQL tables that is effectively a `last_modified` column. When a row is deleted, it doesn't appear as being recently modified because it no longer exists.
  * **Syncs rows on any column update** :The `xmin` column is updated on a per-row basis. If any value of a column in a row changes, the `xmin` value also changes. Therefore, the connector syncs a row when a column is updated, regardless of whether you selected that column in the connection schema. There is no way for the connector to know to ignore that update.
  * **Performance overhead** : XMIN method requires a full table scan to detect updated rows, which can slow down updates and cause significant processing overhead on your PostgreSQL server.**
  *  **Freezing and wraparound in high-volume databases:** In high-volume transactional databases, freezing and wraparound events may occur with XMIN because of the loss of the state in some circumstances, resulting in [automatic re-syncs](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases#automaticresync) that may increase your sync time.**


> **IMPORTANT: To address the last two limitations (performance overhead and freezing/wraparound issues), enable the `pageinspect` and `pg_visibility` XMIN extensions. Enabling these extensions can greatly increase the speed of incremental syncs and full imports, as well as handle wraparound scenarios. We highly recommend this solution for Enterprise-level users who use the XMIN incremental sync method. See our [FAQ page](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/troubleshooting/xmin-wraparound-causing-excess-mar) for more information on enabling these extensions.
Therefore, we only use the XMIN method if [WAL](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logical-replication) is not an option for you. We recommend using WAL as the primary incremental sync method if you have a high-volume transactional database.
### Fivetran Teleport Sync[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#fivetranteleportsync)
Fivetran Teleport Sync is a proprietary incremental sync method that can add delete capture with no additional setup other than a read-only SQL connection. Teleport captures updates using the [XMIN system column](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xminsystemcolumn).
Use Fivetran Teleport Sync if enabling logical replication is not an option or if your Postgres version is below 16 and you want to capture deletes from a read replica.
> NOTE: Fivetran Teleport Sync supports syncing tables with composite primary keys.
Fivetran Teleport Sync's queries perform the following operations on your database:
  * Do an index scan of each synced table's primary keys
  * Aggregate a compressed table snapshot in the database's memory


For optimum Fivetran Teleport Sync performance, we recommend that you make the following resources available in your database:
  * 1 GB Free RAM
  * 1 Free CPU Core
  * IOPS (Teleport Sync times decrease linearly with an increase of available IOPS).


> NOTE: Teleport captures deletes differently than log-based replication mechanisms. Learn more in the [Changes to data between syncs section of our history mode documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts/sync-modes/history-mode#changestodatabetweensyncs).
Fivetran Teleport Sync can sync the following DDL commands without needing to re-sync the table:
  * Adding a new column
  * Changing an existing column's data type
  * Data type changes that do not affect existing values (For example, INT to BIGINT)', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#solution", "source": "fivetran.com",

using the `pgoutput` plugin, including setup, limitations, and related features like logical decoding, partitioning, and the use of the XMIN method as a fallback.
---
Fivetran supports the `pgoutput` plugin for logical replication. Your plugin must have its own replication slot. Ensure that you are connected to the correct database when you create your replication slot, or your connection will not be able to find the slot.
However, there are reasons why you might not want to or be able to use logical replication:
  * Logical replication does not replicate all DDL changes. Learn which DDL changes are supported in the [Support for DDL changes table](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#supportforddlchanges).
  * Logical replication does not replicate data from [generated columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html).
  * For PostgreSQL versions 13 and later, logical replication can replicate partitioned tables. Learn more in PostgreSQL's [logical replication restrictions documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html).
  * Creating a column with the `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN SET DEFAULT` command does not trigger an update to the existing table that the logical replication mechanism can recognize. Consequently, those changes are not part of our incremental updates. You need to do a full table re-sync to update the existing table's data in the destination. Learn more in [PostgreSQL's Modifying Tables documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-alter.html).
  * Heroku PostgreSQL does not support logical replication.


> NOTE: Fivetran does not support logical replication if you use the "swap and drop" method of replicating data. In the "swap and drop" method, you create a temporary table and load in data from your current table. You then drop the current table and rename the temporary table so it has the same name as your current table.
If logical replication is not an option for you, Fivetran can fall back on using the XMIN method.
[See our FAQ documentation for help in migrating your `test_decoding` connection to `pgoutput`](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/troubleshooting/migrating-wal-plugin).
#### Logical decoding output plugin[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logicaldecodingoutputplugin)
`pgoutput` is the standard logical decoding plugin for PostgreSQL version 10+. This plugin replicates from your custom publication without needing additional libraries.
> NOTE: A publication is a group of change events for a table or group of tables that you choose. To learn more, read PostgreSQL's [publication documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html).
`pgoutput` allows you to use PostgreSQL's publications feature. This feature only replicates change events from tables in your publication, so you control which changes are replicated to Fivetran.
#### Declarative partitioning[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#declarativepartitioning)
Newly-added partitions are not automatically included in your syncs unless your [schema configuration](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/fivetran-dashboard/connectors/schema#defineschemachangehandlingsettings) is set to **Allow All**.
> NOTE: Logical replication in PostgreSQL versions 10-12 does not support adding partitioned tables directly to the publication. If your workflow involves regularly creating new partitions, you must add each new partition to the publication, either manually or automatically through setting up a trigger. Otherwise, your syncs may be rescheduled because of the missing partitions in the publication.
For connections created before November 8, 2022, we sync incremental data from partitioned tables into partitions. If you'd like it synced into the parent table instead, reach out to [Fivetran Support](https://support.fivetran.com/).
For connections created on or after November 8, 2022, we sync incremental data from partitioned tables into the parent table. If you'd like to sync your partitions individually, reach out to [Fivetran Support](https://support.fivetran.com/).
#### Partitioning using inheritance[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#partitioningusinginheritance)
Because a child table can inherit from multiple root tables, we treat each table as a separate entity. Therefore, the data physically residing in a parent table is synced into the corresponding parent table in the destination. Similarly, the data physically residing in a child table is synced into the corresponding child table in the destination. You can use the `ONLY` keyword in a select statement to query data that physically resides in a specific table, excluding data in its child tables.
If you want to see the result of `SELECT * FROM base_table` in the destination instead, set up a trigger to propagate changes from child tables to the base table in the source. If this is not an option, consider creating a view in the destination to aggregate data from child tables to the base table.

We sync unknown data types to the destination as strings. If we are missing an important type that you need, [reach out to support](https://support.fivetran.com/).
In some cases, when loading data into your destination, we may need to convert Fivetran data types into data types that are supported by the destination. For more information, see the [individual data destination pages](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations).
#### Unparseable values[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#unparseablevalues)
When we encounter an unparsable value of one of the following data types, we substitute it with a default value. Which default value we use depends on whether the unparsable value is in a primary key column or non-primary key column:
PostgreSQL Type| Primary Key Value| Non-Primary Key Value  
---|---|---  
TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE| `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`| `null`  
TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE| `1970-01-01T00:00`| `null`  
TSRANGE *| `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`| `null`  
TSTZRANGE *| `1970-01-01T00:00`| `null`  
*If we are unable to parse either the start or end value in your range, we substitute that value with the default value. If we are unable to parse both values, we replace both values with default values.
### PostGIS geography data types[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#postgisgeographydatatypes)
The following table lists Fivetran-supported PostGIS geography data types. They are transformed according to the [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/) specification and stored in the destination as JSON types. The GeoJson specification does not support SRID, so Fivetran ignores this data type.

### Enumerated types[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#enumeratedtypes)
Fivetran supports enumerated types (ENUM), which are user-defined data types. Learn more in PostgreSQL's [Enumerated Types documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-enum.html).
We transform and store enumerated types as STRING in the destination.
### Domain data types[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#domaindatatypes)
Fivetran supports domains, which are user-defined data types. When you create a domain, you choose an underlying data type and have the option of specifying additional constraints. Learn more in PostgreSQL's [domains documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/domains.html).
We transform and store domain data based on their underlying data types.
### Excluding source data[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#excludingsourcedata)
If you don’t want to sync all the data from your source database, you can exclude schemas, tables, or columns from your syncs on your Fivetran dashboard. To do so, go to your connection details page and uncheck the objects you would like to omit from syncing. For more information, see our [Data Blocking documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/features/data-blocking-column-hashing).
Alternatively, you can restrict the Fivetran user's access to certain tables or columns in your source database.
> NOTE: You cannot exclude columns which are primary keys or foreign keys.
#### How to allow only a subset of tables:[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#howtoallowonlyasubsetoftables)
To grant access only to some tables in a schema, first make sure that the Fivetran user has access to the schema itself:
```
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "some_schema" TO fivetran;

```

Next, remove any previously granted permissions to all tables in that schema:', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#solution", "source": "fivetran.com", "headers": "##

```
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "some_schema" REVOKE SELECT ON TABLES FROM fivetran;
REVOKE SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "some_schema" FROM fivetran;

```

Repeat this command for each table you wish to include:
```
GRANT SELECT ON "some_schema"."some_table" TO fivetran;
GRANT SELECT ON "other_schema".* TO fivetran; /* all tables in schema */

```

Any tables created in the future will be excluded from the Fivetran user by default. To include them, run:
```
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "some_schema" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO fivetran;

```

There is no way to grant access to all tables at once, so you need to individually select all the tables you do want. It is not possible to achieve exclusion by granting Fivetran access to all tables and then revoking access for a subset of tables.
#### How to allow only a subset of columns:[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#howtoallowonlyasubsetofcolumns)
To grant access only to some columns in a table, first remove any previously granted permission to all columns in the table:
```
REVOKE SELECT ON "some_schema"."some_table" FROM fivetran;

```

Then grant permission to only specific columns (for example, `some_column` and `other_column`:)
```
GRANT SELECT (xmin, "some_column", "other_column") ON "some_schema"."some_table" TO fivetran;

```

Any new columns added to that table in the future will be excluded from access by default. To include them, re-run the command above with the new column included.
To grant access to all columns except one, you must individually grant access to all other columns. If you are using XMIN as your change data capture method, you must also grant permissions to the hidden system column `xmin`. We need access to the `xmin` column to perform our incremental updates.
You can automate this process by scripting in your favorite language. Here is an example of a fixed set of SQL commands being executed via a BASH script:
```
#!/bin/sh
#Fill in the values without quotes or a space after the equals
host=     # ex: 10.10.135.135
port=     # ex: 30054
user=     # ex: user
password=   # ex: asdf235235asfsdf212
#List all of your SQL commands wrapped in single quotes, for example
sql=(
'REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM fivetran;'
'GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO fivetran;'
'GRANT SELECT ON schema1.* TO fivetran;'
'GRANT SELECT ON schema1.* TO fivetran;'
)
#Connecting to Redshift, hence the PGPASSWORD
do
 PGPASSWORD=$password psql --host=$host --port=$port --user=$user $db -c "${sql[$i]}"

The third column in the query results, `has_primary_key`, is a binary value that shows whether or not each table has a primary key.
### Deleted rows[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#deletedrows)
For logical replication, we can capture deletes for tables without primary keys if the replica identity set to FULL or INDEX.
Fivetran Teleport Sync captures deletes differently than log-based replication mechanisms. Learn more in the [Changes to data between syncs section of our history mode documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts/sync-modes/history-mode#changestodatabetweensyncs).
The XMIN update mechanism does not allow us to recognize deleted rows at all. (For more information, see our [XMIN documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xminsystemcolumn).) Rows that are deleted in the source database are still present in the destination, because there is no way for us to identify them. If you want to recognize deleted rows, use one of these strategies to capture deletions in the source database:
  1. Add a trigger to each table to log the primary keys of deleted rows in a separate table. Once this table has been replicated to the destination, you can use it to generate a view that excludes the deleted rows.
  2. Instead of removing rows, add an 'is_deleted' column to each table and change the business logic to set this column to `TRUE` when you delete a row. To avoid build up of obsolete rows in the source database, you can delete them after a certain period. Make sure you leave enough time for Fivetran replicate the deleted rows to the destination before you remove them (we recommend seven days).


### Support for DDL changes[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#supportforddlchanges)
We support different DDL changes based on which incremental sync method your connection uses. The following is a non-exhaustive list of supported DDL changes:
  * Yes: The DDL change is reflected in the destination. You do not need to perform a re-sync.
  * Partially: The DDL change is partially reflected in the destination.
  * No: The DDL change is not reflected in the destination.', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#solution", "source": "fivetran.com", "headers": "####

handling strategies for Fivetran's PostgreSQL Teleport Sync method, including supported table types, change tracking, and setup considerations.
---
We only recommend the use of the Teleport Sync method if [WAL](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logical-replication) or [XMIN](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xmin-system-column) is not an option for you. We recommend using WAL as the primary incremental sync method if you have a high-volume transactional database.
#### Limitations[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#limitations)
  * Fivetran Teleport Sync cannot sync tables without a primary key. It can only sync tables with primary keys of the following types:
    * Constrained VARCHAR
    * TEXT
    * UUID
    * BIGINT
    * SMALLINT
    * INT
    * Constrained NUMERIC
    * DATE
> NOTE: For TEXT type primary keys, we only support syncing rows with IDs that have 500 characters or fewer.
> NOTE: We only support syncing constrained VARCHARs when their maximum length is less than 13296 characters.
  * If you update large portions of a table between syncs, Fivetran Teleport Sync may be unable to determine the changes since the previous sync. When this occurs, the connection will re-sync the entire table to capture the latest data. To avoid these table re-syncs, we recommend that you increase the sync frequency of the connection.
  * Fast-changing rows may not be marked as deleted in the destination. We consider a row fast changing if more than one of the following operations are applied to it within the connection's sync frequency:
    * `INSERT`
    * `UPDATE`
    * `DELETE`


We do not support syncing more than 400 tables or tables with more than 50 million rows with Fivetran Teleport Sync for PostgreSQL.
### Tables with a primary key[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#tableswithaprimarykey)
We merge changes to tables with primary keys into the corresponding tables in your destination:
  * An `INSERT` in the source table generates a new row in the destination.
  * An `UPDATE` in the source table updates the data in the corresponding row in the destination.
  * (For logical replication) A `DELETE` in the source table updates the corresponding row in the destination with `_fivetran_deleted = TRUE`.


> NOTE: Fivetran requires `SELECT` permissions for all primary key columns in every table with a primary key that you want to sync. If you use logical replication as your incremental sync method, all primary key columns _must_ be part of the publication.
### Tables without a primary key[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#tableswithoutaprimarykey)
Fivetran Teleport Sync does not support tables without a primary key. It can only sync tables with integer or string primary keys.
We handle changes to tables without a primary key in the following ways:
  * An `INSERT` in the source generates a new row in the destination.
  * An `UPDATE` in the source generates a new row in the destination and leaves the old version of that row in the destination untouched. As a result, one record in your source database may have several corresponding rows in your destination.


For logical replication, we can track deletes if the table's replica identity is set to FULL or INDEX. Otherwise, we can only track inserts. Learn more in the [Deleted Rows section](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#deletedrows).
### Identify tables with primary keys[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#identifytableswithprimarykeys)
To find out which of your tables have (or don't have) primary keys, run this query:
```
SELECT
 table_schema,
 table_name,
 (table_schema, table_name) IN (
   SELECT
    _schema.nspname AS table_schema,
    _table.relname AS table_name
   FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c
    LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_class _table ON c.conrelid = _table.oid
    LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace _schema ON _table.relnamespace = _schema.oid
   WHERE c.contype = 'p'
 ) AS has_primary_key
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' AND table_schema NOT IN ('information_schema', 'looker_scratch') AND
   NOT table_schema ~ '^pg_';', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#solution", "source": "fivetran.com", "headers": "### Deleted

---
DDL Statement| Logical Replication| XMIN| Fivetran Teleport Sync| Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
CREATE TABLE| Yes| Yes| Yes| All methods: Creates a new table in the destination.  
CREATE SCHEMA| Yes| Yes| Yes|   
ADD COLUMN| Yes| Yes| Yes| All methods: Rows synced before the ADD COLUMN operation have `null` values in the newly added destination column. Re-sync the table to update the existing rows with the default value.  
ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT| Partially| Partially| Partially| All methods: Rows synced before the ADD COLUMN operation have `null` values in the newly added destination column, and won’t automatically have the default value. Re-sync the table to update the existing rows with the default value.  
RENAME TO _new_table_name_|  No| No| No| All methods: The subsequent sync imports the table as a new table.  
RENAME TO _new_schema_name_|  No| No| No| All methods: The subsequent sync imports the schema as a new schema.  
RENAME COLUMN| Yes| Yes| Yes| All methods: Adds a new column to the destination. The old column still exists in the destination. We sync new rows inserted after this DDL operation to the new column. If you need data in the new column from before the DDL operation, trigger a table re-sync.  
DROP COLUMN| No| No| No|   
ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE ...| Yes| Yes| Yes| Logical Replication: We support any data types changing to string-based data types. If your data type change is not backward compatible (for example, TEXT to BOOLEAN), drop the replication slot and perform a historical re-sync. XMIN: Certain destinations support data type changes, such as BigQuery and PostgreSQL. Fivetran Teleport Sync: We support all non-primary key data type changes. For primary keys, we only support data type changes that don't affect the value. Unsupported primary key data type changes cause the subsequent sync to re-import the table.  
ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE ... USING| No| Yes| Yes| Fivetran Teleport Sync: We support all non-primary key data type changes. For primary keys, we only support data type changes that don't affect the value. Unsupported primary key data type changes cause the subsequent sync to re-import the table.  
ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL| No| No| No|   
DROP SCHEMA| No| No| No|   
DROP TABLE| No| No| No|   
TRUNCATE TABLE| Yes| No| Yes| Logical Replication: If you truncate a partition, that change is _not_ reflected in the destination. Truncating one table in a transaction is supported. Truncating a table and its dependent tables using TRUNCATE CASCADE is _not_ supported. If you want to truncate multiple tables, truncate one table per transaction. XMIN: Re-sync the table to capture the truncate change.  
## Historical re-sync scenarios[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#historicalresyncscenarios)
  * If you want to migrate to another service provider, we will need to do a full re-sync of your data because the new service provider will not retain the same change tracking data as your original PostgreSQL database.
  * If you want to switch update methods to or from Teleport
  * If you want to switch update methods from using logical replication to XMIN


## Specific conditions for rescheduled syncs[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#specificconditionsforrescheduledsyncs)
In addition to the [general conditions for rescheduled syncs](https://fivetran.com/docs/core-concepts/syncoverview#synchistorychart), we reschedule syncs for our PostgreSQL connections under the following conditions:
  * When historical re-sync has taken too long with logical replication update method, we need to reschedule sync so that WAL changes extracted can be consumed and flushed from replication slot.
  * When Teleport is not able to capture all changes

---
```
GRANT SELECT ON "some_schema"."some_table" TO <username>;

```

  4. By default, any tables that you create in the future will be excluded from the Fivetran user's access. To grant access to new tables, run the following command.
```
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "some_schema" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <username>;

```


Restrict access to columns (optional)
If you want to limit Fivetran's access to the columns in your tables, grant the Fivetran user access to only certain columns.
  1. Revoke any previously granted permission to read all columns in the table.
```
REVOKE SELECT ON "some_schema"."some_table" FROM <username>;

```

  2. Grant permission to the specific columns you want to sync (for example, `some_column` and `other_column`).
> IMPORTANT: If you chose XMIN as your incremental sync method, you must grant us access to the hidden system column `xmin`. While it's not mandatory, you can also grant us access to the hidden system column `ctid` to make your initial sync faster.
```
GRANT SELECT (xmin, ctid, some_column, other_column) ON "some_schema"."some_table" TO <username>;

```



Once you restrict access to columns within a table, the Fivetran user will not have access to any new columns added to that table in the future. To grant access to new columns, you must rerun the command above.
### Configure incremental sync method[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#configureincrementalsyncmethod)
Configure your chosen incremental sync method:
Logical replication
To enable logical replication, follow these steps:
  1. Go to your PostgreSQL database.
  2. Ensure that your server has ample free space for the logs. As soon as Fivetran processes a log, we delete it. However, we don't delete logs if the sync is interrupted (for example, if we lose access to your database). In this case, logs may accumulate on your server and consume additional storage. The amount of additional disk space that these logs consume is proportional to the number of changes committed on the server. If we can't resume a lost connection quickly enough and you need more disk space, you can drop the replication slot, which deletes its unconsumed logs.
  3. Ensure that the `statement_timeout` setting on your server is either `0` (the default value to disable the timeout) or greater than `5 minute`.
  4. Set the `wal_level` parameter in your database configuration to `logical`. For a standard PostgreSQL database, do this by adding a `wal_level = logical` line to the `postgresql.conf1` file. Restart the server for this change to take effect.
  5. Ensure that your `max_replication_slots` value is equal to or higher than the number of PostgreSQL connectors that use logical replication _plus_ the number of other replication slots your database uses.
  6. Set the `wal_sender_timeout` parameter in your database configuration to `0` to disable the timeout.
  7. Add a [record](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) to your `pg_hba.conf` file that allows your database to authenticate Fivetran's connection to the WAL.
  8. Go to the `postgresql.conf` file and ensure that the `max_wal_senders` parameter, which specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections to the WAL, is at least twice the total number of logical replication slots. For example, if your database uses 11 replication slots in total, then the `max_wal_senders` value must be 22 or greater.
  9. Use a PostgreSQL console (such as a SQL workbench or psql) to log in to your primary database as a superuser.
  10. Create a publication for your tables. If you want, you can create a publication for only certain tables so that you add or remove tables from the publication later on. Only changes from tables in the publication are replicated to Fivetran. Each database can have multiple distinct publications. You _must_ have `CREATE` privileges or above to run this command.
> IMPORTANT: The publication name `fivetran_pub` quoted throughout this guide is used purely as an example. The actual publication name should be unique for every database and cannot start with a number.
```
CREATE PUBLICATION fivetran_pub FOR TABLE table2, table4, table8;

```

To add or remove a table from a publication, run the following command. You must have ownership rights over the table(s).
```
ALTER PUBLICATION fivetran_pub ADD/DROP TABLE table_name;

```

Alternatively, you can create a publication for all of your tables. However, you _cannot_ remove any table from this publication later on. You _must_ have superuser privileges to run this command.
```
 CREATE PUBLICATION fivetran_pub FOR ALL TABLES;

```

(Optional) You can choose which operations to include in the publication. For example, the following publication includes only `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations.
```

# Generic PostgreSQL Setup Guide [](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#genericpostgresqlsetupguide)
Follow these instructions to replicate your generic PostgreSQL database to your destination using Fivetran.
## Prerequisites[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#prerequisites)
To connect your generic PostgreSQL database to Fivetran, you need:
  * PostgreSQL version 9.4 - 17
  * Your database host's IP (e.g., `1.2.3.4`) or domain (`your.server.com`)
  * Your database's port (usually `5432`)
  * TLS enabled on your database


## Setup instructions[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#setupinstructions)
> IMPORTANT: _Do not_ perform the [Choose connection method step](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#chooseconnectionmethodtlsrequired) in the following scenarios:
>   * You want to use the [Hybrid Deployment model](https://fivetran.com/docs/deployment-models/hybrid-deployment) for your data pipeline
>   * You are setting up a connection for the [PostgreSQL native app](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/snowflake/fivetran-postgresql-app)
> 

### Choose connection method (TLS required)[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#chooseconnectionmethodtlsrequired)
> IMPORTANT: You _must_ have TLS enabled on your database to connect to Fivetran.
Decide how you want to connect your database to Fivetran. How you configure your security groups in later steps will differ depending on this decision.
Connect directly
Fivetran connects directly to your database instance. This is the simplest method.
If you connect directly, you will create a rule in a security group that allows Fivetran access to your database instance.
Connect using SSH
Fivetran connects to a separate server in your network that provides an SSH tunnel to your database. You must connect through SSH if your database resides in an inaccessible subnet.
If you connect using SSH:
  * configure your SSH tunnel server's security group to allow Fivetran access
  * configure your database's security to allow access from the tunnel


Before you proceed to the next step, you must follow our [SSH connection instructions](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/connection-options#sshtunnel).
Connect using private networking
> IMPORTANT: You must have a [Business Critical plan](https://www.fivetran.com/pricing/features) to use private networking.
Private networking enables communication between private networks and services without exposing traffic to the public internet. Private networking is the most secure connection method. We support the following providers:
  * [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/?privatelink-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&privatelink-blogs.sort-order=desc) – used for VPCs and AWS-hosted or on-premises services. See [our AWS PrivateLink setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/connection-options#awsprivatelink) for details
  * [Azure PrivateLink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) – used for Virtual Networks (VNets) and Azure-hosted or on-premises services. See [our Azure PrivateLink setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/connection-options#azureprivatelink) for details
  * [Google Cloud Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect) – used for VPCs and Google-hosted or on-premises services. See our [Google Cloud Private Service Connect setup guide](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/connection-options#googlecloudprivateserviceconnect) for details', '{"url":

Agent, choose an incremental sync method (logical replication, XMIN, or Teleport Sync), and set up a dedicated read-only user with appropriate access and privileges.
---
Connect using Proxy Agent
Fivetran connects to your database through the Proxy Agent, providing secure communication between Fivetran processes and your database host. The Proxy Agent is installed in your network and creates an outbound network connection to the Fivetran-managed SaaS.
To learn more about the Proxy Agent, how to install it, and how to configure it, see our [Proxy Agent documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/connection-options#proxyagent).
### Choose incremental sync method[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#chooseincrementalsyncmethod)
To keep your data up to date after the initial sync, we use one of the following incremental sync methods. The logical replication and XMIN methods keep a record of recent data changes, which allows Fivetran to update only the data that has changed since our last sync. Fivetran Teleport Sync instead takes snapshots of tables to calculate differences.
> TIP: We recommend using logical replication as your incremental sync method because it is faster than XMIN replication and allows Fivetran to detect deleted rows for tables with primary keys. Learn more in our [Updating data documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#updatingdata).
Choose your incremental sync method:
> NOTE: You will configure your incremental sync method in later steps.
Logical replication
> IMPORTANT: You can only enable logical replication if your PostgreSQL version is 10 or later. If you want to use logical replication on a read replica, your PostgreSQL version must be 16 or later.
Logical replication is based on [logical decoding](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding.html) of the PostgreSQL write-ahead log (WAL). Fivetran reads the WAL using the `pgoutput` plugin to detect any new or changed data. This plugin replicates from your custom publication without needing additional libraries.
To learn more, see our [logical replication documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#logicalreplication).
XMIN
The XMIN method is based on the hidden `xmin` system column that is present in all PostgreSQL tables. With XMIN, Fivetran must scan every table in full to detect updated data. We do not recommend XMIN for near real-time data needs because XMIN replication is slower than logical replication and doesn't allow Fivetran to detect deleted rows.
Learn more in our [XMIN documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xminsystemcolumn).
Fivetran Teleport Sync
Fivetran Teleport Sync is a proprietary incremental sync method that can add delete capture with no additional setup other than a read-only SQL connection. Updates will be captured using the [XMIN system column](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#xminsystemcolumn).
Learn more in our [Fivetran Teleport Sync documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#fivetranteleportsync).
### Create user[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#createuser)
Create a database user for Fivetran's exclusive use.
  1. Open a connection to your PostgreSQL database in a PostgreSQL console (such as a SQL workbench or psql).
  2. Create a user for Fivetran by executing the following SQL command. Replace `<username>` and `some-password` with a username and password of your choice.


```
CREATE USER <username> PASSWORD 'some-password';

```

### Grant read-only access[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#grantreadonlyaccess)
Grant the Fivetran user read-only access to all tables by running the following commands. To grant access to a schema other than PostgreSQL's default `public` schema, replace `public` with the schema name.
```
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "public" TO <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "public" TO <username>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "public" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <username>;

```

> NOTE: The last command makes sure that any future tables will be accessible to Fivetran.
If you want to grant access to multiple schemas, you must run these three commands for each schema.
Restrict access to tables (optional)
If you want to limit Fivetran's access to your tables, grant the Fivetran user access to only the tables that you would like to sync. You must individually grant access for each table that you want to sync. You cannot grant access to all tables and then revoke access for a subset of tables.
  1. Ensure that the Fivetran user has access to the schema that contains your table(s).
```
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "some_schema" TO <username>;

```

  2. Revoke any previously granted permission to all tables in that schema.
```
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "some_schema" REVOKE SELECT ON TABLES FROM <username>;
REVOKE SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "some_schema" FROM <username>;

```

  3. Repeat the following command for each table you want Fivetran to sync.', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide", "source": "fivetran.com", "headers": "###

> NOTE: You must run the command above in the parent database because you cannot create new objects in read replicas. This command propagates the function to the read-only replica.
If you are not connecting with a read replica, you do not need to do any additional configuration. The aggregate that the Teleport mechanism will later use is automatically created for you.
### Finish Fivetran configuration[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#finishfivetranconfiguration)
  1. In your [connection setup form](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/fivetran-dashboard/connectors#addanewconnection), enter a **Destination schema prefix**. This is used as the connection name and cannot be modified once the connection is created.
> NOTE: Depending on your selection in the [**Destination schema names**](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#destinationschemanames) field, we will either prefix the connection name to each replicated schema or use the source schema names instead.
  2. In the **Host** field, enter your database host's IP (for example, `1.2.3.4`) or domain (for example, `your.server.com`).
  3. Enter your database instance's **port** number. The port number is usually `5432`.
  4. Enter the Fivetran-specific **user** that you created in [Step 2](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#createuser).
  5. Enter the **password** for the Fivetran-specific user that you created in [Step 2](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#createuser).
  6. Enter the name of your database (for example, `your_database`).
  7. ([Hybrid Deployment](https://fivetran.com/docs/deployment-models/hybrid-deployment) and [PostgreSQL native app](https://fivetran.com/docs/destinations/snowflake/fivetran-postgresql-app) only) If your destination is configured for Hybrid Deployment, the Hybrid Deployment Agent associated with your destination is pre-selected in the **Select an existing agent** drop-down menu. To use a different agent, select the agent of your choice, and then select the same agent for your destination.
  8. (Not applicable to Hybrid Deployment and PostgreSQL native app) Choose your **connection method**. If you selected **Connect via an SSH tunnel** , copy or make a note of the **Public Key** and add it to the `authorized_keys` file while [configuring the SSH tunnel](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/connection-options#sshtunnel), and provide the following information:
     * SSH hostname (do not use a load balancer's IP address/hostname)
     * SSH port
     * SSH user
  9. Choose your **Update Method**. If you selected **Logical Replication** , enter both the name of your database's **replication slot** and **publication name** accordingly.
  10. In the **Destination schema names** field, select **Fivetran naming** or **Source naming** to determine how the schema names appear in your destination. For more information, see the [Schema information](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql#schemainformation) section.
  11. (Not applicable to Hybrid Deployment) Copy the [Fivetran's IP addresses (or CIDR)](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/ips) that you _must_ safelist in your firewall.
  12. Click **Save & Test**. Fivetran tests and validates our connection to your PostgreSQL database. Upon successful completion of the setup tests, you can sync your data using Fivetran.', '{"url": "https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide", "source": "fivetran.com",

### Setup tests[](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide#setuptests)
Fivetran performs the following tests to ensure that we can connect to your generic PostgreSQL database and that it is properly configured:
  * The Connecting to SSH Tunnel Test validates the SSH tunnel details you provided in the setup form. It then checks that we can connect to your database using the SSH Tunnel. (We skip this test if you aren't connecting using SSH.)
  * The Connecting to Host Test validates the database credentials you provided in the setup form. The test verifies that the host is not private and then checks the connectivity to the host.
  * The Validating Certificate Test generates a pop-up window where you must choose which certificate you want Fivetran to use. It then validates that certificate and checks that we can connect to your database using TLS. (We skip this test if you selected an indirect connection method and then disabled the Require TLS through Tunnel toggle.)
  * The Connecting to Database Test checks that we can access your database.
  * The Connecting to WAL Replication Slot Test confirms that the database associated with the replication slot matches the name you supplied in the setup form. It then verifies that the replication slot uses the `pgoutput` plugin. Lastly, it makes sure that the Fivetran user has replication privileges. (We skip this test if you selected XMIN or Teleport as your incremental sync method)
  * The Checking Configuration Values Test checks a set of WAL-configured values against the recommended settings and detects if they are below the recommended range. (We skip this test if you selected XMIN as your incremental sync method.)
  * The Publication Test verifies that the supplied publication name exists in your database. (We skip this test if you selected XMIN as your incremental sync method.)
  * The Validating Speed Setup test validates Fivetran can fetch data from your source database quickly enough. During this test, we measure our ability to download sample data from your source database to Fivetran, but we do _not_ perform a historical sync. We start a timer, then download the sample data in memory. We then calculate the connection speed based on how much data we downloaded and how long it took to download. The test shows a warning if the download speed is less than 5MB/sec.
  * The XMIN Extensions test checks that the correct extensions are enabled for XMIN. (This test is skipped if you select Logical Replication as your incremental sync method.)


> NOTE: The tests may take a few minutes to finish running.

or later for logical replication, including creating publications with partitioned tables, setting up logical replication slots, and granting necessary permissions for Fivetran data synchronization.
---
```

To add partitioned tables for PostgreSQL version 13 or later, run the following command to enable publish_via_partition_root.
```
CREATE PUBLICATION fivetran_pub FOR ALL TABLES WITH (publish_via_partition_root=true);

```

  11. Create a logical replication slot for the database you want to sync by running the following command. You _must_ use the standard output plugin `pgoutput`. Ensure that you are connected to the correct database when you create your replication slot, or your connection will not be able to find the slot.
> IMPORTANT: You _must_ create a unique [replication slot](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html#LOGICALDECODING-REPLICATION-SLOTS) for every connection that uses the same [PostgreSQL cluster](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/creating-cluster.html). Replication slot names cannot start with a number. (The replication slot name `fivetran_pgoutput_slot` quoted throughout this guide is used purely as an example.)
> IMPORTANT: You need to create the replication slot _after_ you have created the publication.
```
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('fivetran_pgoutput_slot', 'pgoutput');

```

> NOTE: If your PostgreSQL server version is 16 or later and you want to sync from a standby, create the replication slot in the read replica.
> NOTE: Starting with PostgreSQL 17, `pg_upgrade` supports migrating logical replication slots. When upgrading from a cluster running version 17.0 or later, `pg_upgrade` attempts to [migrate logical slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html) automatically. When upgrading from a cluster running a version earlier than 17.0, logical replication slots must be recreated manually.
  12. Verify that your chosen tables are in the publication.
```
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables;

```

  13. Grant the Fivetran user permission to read the replication slot.
```
ALTER ROLE <username> WITH REPLICATION;

```

  14. Log in as the Fivetran user.
  15. Verify that the Fivetran user can read the replication slot by running the following command. Replace `fivetran_pgoutput_slot` with your replication slot name and `fivetran_pub` with the publication name.
```
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_logical_slot_peek_binary_changes('fivetran_pgoutput_slot', null, null, 'proto_version', '1', 'publication_names', 'fivetran_pub');

```

If the query succeeds, then permissions are sufficient.


> IMPORTANT: You must periodically tune the `checkpoint_timeout` and `max_wal_size` parameters based on your PostgreSQL database operations. If you do not, you may experience replication failures. To learn how to tune, read [this tuning checkpoints documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/tuning-maxwalsize-postgresql).
XMIN
The XMIN method is based on the hidden `xmin` system column that is present in all PostgreSQL tables.
We recommend that you filter frozen pages from incremental syncs. Filtering makes incremental syncs significantly shorter, which means that we use fewer resources in your source database.
(Optional) To filter frozen pages, run the following commands on your primary database _as a superuser_ :
```
CREATE EXTENSION pg_visibility;
CREATE SCHEMA fivetran;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fivetran.get_all_pages(v_table_name character varying)
RETURNS TABLE (
  pagenumber integer,
  all_visible_yn boolean,
  all_frozen_yn boolean)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY definer
AS $function$
declare
begin
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT blkno::int as pageNumber,
      all_visible as all_visible_yn,
      all_frozen as all_frozen_yn
  FROM pg_visibility_map($1::regclass);
END;
$function$;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA fivetran TO <username>;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION fivetran.get_all_pages TO <username>;

```

Fivetran Teleport Sync
To connect to a standby or read replica, run the following SQL command on your primary database as the Fivetran user:
```

Partition Endpoint
# Partition Endpoint parameters
The Unstructured Partition Endpoint provides parameters to customize the processing of documents. These parameters include:
The only required parameter is `files` - the file you wish to process.
POST, Python| JavaScript/TypeScript| Description  
---|---|---  
`files` (_shared.Files_)| `files` (_File_ , _Blob_ , _shared.Files_)| The file to process.  
`chunking_strategy` (_str_)| `chunkingStrategy` (_string_)| Use one of the supported strategies to chunk the returned elements after partitioning. When no chunking strategy is specified, no chunking is performed and any other chunking parameters provided are ignored. Supported strategies: `basic`, `by_title`, `by_page`, and `by_similarity`. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/chunking).  
`content_type` (_str_)| `contentType` (_string_)| A hint to Unstructured about the content type to use (such as `text/markdown`), when there are problems processing a specific file. This value is a MIME type in the format `type/subtype`. For available MIME types, see [model.py](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/blob/main/unstructured/file_utils/model.py).  
`coordinates` (_bool_)| `coordinates` (_boolean_)| True to return bounding box coordinates for each element extracted with OCR. Default: false. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/examples#saving-bounding-box-coordinates).  
`encoding` (_str_)| `encoding` (_string_)| The encoding method used to decode the text input. Default: `utf-8`.  
`extract_image_block_types` (_List[str]_)| `extractImageBlockTypes` (_string[]_)| The types of elements to extract, for use in extracting image blocks as Base64 encoded data stored in element metadata fields, for example: `["Image","Table"]`. Supported filetypes are image and PDF. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/extract-image-block-types).  
`gz_uncompressed_content_type` (_str_)| `gzUncompressedContentType` (_string_)| If file is gzipped, use this content type after unzipping. Example: `application/pdf`  
`hi_res_model_name` (_str_)| `hiResModelName` (_string_)| The name of the inference model used when strategy is `hi_res`. Options are `layout_v1.1.0` and `yolox`. Default: `layout_v1.1.0`. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/examples#changing-partition-strategy-for-a-pdf).  
`include_page_breaks` (_bool_)| `includePageBreaks` (_boolean_)| True for the output to include page breaks if the filetype supports it. Default: false.  
`languages` (_List[str]_)| `languages` (_string[]_)| The languages present in the document, for use in partitioning and OCR. [View the list of available languages](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata). [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/examples#specifying-the-language-of-a-document-for-better-ocr-results).  
`output_format` (_str_)| `outputFormat` (_string_)| The format of the response. Supported formats are `application/json` and `text/csv`. Default: `application/json`.  
`pdf_infer_table_structure` (_bool_)| `pdfInferTableStructure` (_boolean_)| **Deprecated!** Use `skip_infer_table_types` instead. If true and `strategy` is `hi_res`, any `Table` elements extracted from a PDF will include an additional metadata field, `text_as_html`, where the value (string) is a just a transformation of the data into an HTML table.  
`skip_infer_table_types` (_List[str]_)| `skipInferTableTypes` (_string[]_)| The document types that you want to skip table extraction for. Default: `[]`.  
`starting_page_number` (_int_)| `startingPageNumber` (_number_)| The page number to be be assigned to the first page in the document. This information will be included in elements’ metadata and can be be especially useful when partitioning a document that is part of a larger document.  
`strategy` (_str_)| `strategy` (_string_)| The strategy to use for partitioning PDF and image files. Options are `auto`, `vlm`, `hi_res`, `fast`, and `ocr_only`. Default: `auto`. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/partitioning).  
`unique_element_ids` (_bool_)| `uniqueElementIds` (_boolean_)| True to assign UUIDs to element IDs, which guarantees their uniqueness (useful when using them as primary keys in database). Otherwise a SHA-256 of the element’s text is used. Default: false.  
`vlm_model` (_str_)| (Not yet available)| Applies only when `strategy` is `vlm`. The name of the vision language model (VLM) provider to use for partitioning. `vlm_model_provider` must also be specified. For a list of allowed values, see the end of this article.  
`vlm_model_provider` (_str_)| (Not yet available)| Applies only when `strategy` is `vlm`. The name of the vision language model (VLM) to use for partitioning. `vlm_model` must also be specified. For a list of allowed values, see the end of this article.

he XML tags in the output. Otherwise it will just extract the text from within the tags. Only applies to XML documents.  
The following parameters only apply when a chunking strategy is specified. Otherwise, they are ignored. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/chunking).
POST, Python| JavaScript/TypeScript| Description  
---|---|---  
`combine_under_n_chars` (_int_)| `combineUnderNChars` (_number_)| Applies only when the chunking strategy is set to `by_title`. Use this parameter to combines small chunks until the combined chunk reaches a length of `n` characters. This can mitigate the appearance of small chunks created by short paragraphs, not intended as section headings, being identified as `Title` elements in certain documents. Default: the same value as `max_characters`.  
`include_orig_elements` (_bool_)| `includeOrigElements` (_boolean_)| True (the default) to have the elements that are used to form a chunk appear in `.metadata.orig_elements` for that chunk.  
`max_characters` (_int_)| `maxCharacters` (_number_)| Cut off new sections after reaching a length of `n` characters. (This is a hard maximum.) Default: 500.  
`multipage_sections` (_bool_)| `multipageSections` (_boolean_)| Applies only when the chunking strategy is set to `by_title`. Determines if a chunk can include elements from more than one page. Default: true.  
`new_after_n_chars` (_int_)| `newAfterNChars` (_number_)| Applies only when the chunking strategy is specified. Cuts off new sections after reaching a length of `n` characters. (This is a soft maximum.) Default: 1500.  
`overlap` (_int_)| `overlap` (_number_)| A prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split chunk is applied to second and later chunks formed from oversized elements by text-splitting. Default: none.  
`overlap_all` (_bool_)| `overlapAll` (_boolean_)| True to have an overlap also applied to “normal” chunks formed by combining whole elements. Use with caution, as this can introduce noise into otherwise clean semantic units. Default: none.  
`similarity_threshold` (_float_)| `similarityThreshold` (_number_)| Applies only when the chunking strategy is set to `by_similarity`. The minimum similarity text in consecutive elements must have to be included in the same chunk. Must be between 0.0 and 1.0, exclusive (0.01 to 0.99, inclusive). Default: 0.5.  
The following parameters are specific to the Python and JavaScript/TypeScript clients and are not sent to the server. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#page-splitting).
POST, Python| JavaScript/TypeScript| Description  
---|---|---  
`split_pdf_page` (_bool_)| `splitPdfPage` (_boolean_)| True to split the PDF file client-side. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#page-splitting).  
`split_pdf_allow_failed` (_bool_)| `splitPdfAllowFailed` (_boolean_)| When `true`, a failed split request will not stop the processing of the rest of the document. The affected page range will be ignored in the results. When `false`, a failed split request will cause the entire document to fail. Default: `false`.  
`split_pdf_concurrency_level` (_int_)| `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel` (_number_)| The number of split files to be sent concurrently. Default: 5. Maximum: 15.  
`split_pdf_page_range` (_List[int]_)| `splitPdfPageRange` (_number[]_)| A list of 2 integers within the range `[1, length_of_pdf]`. When pdf splitting is enabled, this will send only the specified page range to the API.', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/api-parameters", "source":

Unstructured API
# Overview
The Unstructured API consists of two parts:
  * The [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview) enables a full range of partitioning, chunking, embedding, and enrichment options for your files and data. It is designed to batch-process files and data in remote locations; send processed results to various storage, databases, and vector stores; and use the latest and highest-performing models on the market today. It has built-in logic to deliver the highest quality results at the lowest cost. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview).
  * The [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview) is intended for rapid prototyping of Unstructured’s various partitioning strategies, with limited support for chunking. It is designed to work only with processing of local files, one file at a time. Use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview) for production-level scenarios, file processing in batches, files and data in remote locations, generating embeddings, applying post-transform enrichments, using the latest and highest-performing models, and for the highest quality results at the lowest cost. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview).

Benefits over open source
The Unstructured API provides the following benefits beyond the [Unstructured open source library](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/introduction/overview) offering:
  * Designed for production scenarios.
  * Significantly increased performance on document and table extraction.
  * Access to newer and more sophisticated vision transformer models.
  * Access to Unstructured’s fine-tuned OCR models.
  * Access to Unstructured’s by-page and by-similarity chunking strategies.
  * Adherence to security and SOC2 Type 1, SOC2 Type 2, and HIPAA compliance standards.
  * Authentication and identity management.
  * Incremental data loading.
  * Image extraction from documents.
  * More sophisticated document hierarchy detection.
  * Unstructured manages code dependencies, for instance for libraries such as Tesseract.
  * Unstructured manages its own infrastructure, including parallelization and other performance optimizations.

Legacy APIs
# Unstructured API on Azure
The Unstructured API on Azure is deprecated. It is no longer supported and is not being actively updated. Unstructured is now available on the Azure Marketplace as a private offering. To explore supported options for running Unstructured within your virtual private cloud (VPC), email Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
This page is not being actively updated. It might contain out-of-date information. This page is provided for legacy reference purposes only.
Follow these steps to deploy the Unstructured API service into your Azure account.
This article describes how to create several interrelated resources in your Azure account. Your Azure account will be charged on an ongoing basis for these resources, even if you are not actively using them. Manually shutting down the associated Azure virtual machine when you are not using it can help reduce—but not fully eliminate—these ongoing charges. To stop accruing all related ongoing charges, you must delete all of the associated Azure resources.

```

  1. The environment variables should be in the list that appears.


To help manage your overall costs, you should click the **Stop** icon whenever you are not using this virtual machine to call the Unstructured API.
10
Call the Unstructured API
You can now use the running virtual machine to call the Unstructured API. For example, run one of the following, setting the following environment variables to make your code more portable:
  * Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to `http://`, followed by your load balancer’s public IP address, followed by `/general/v0/general`.
  * Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine to the files for the Unstructured API to process. If you do not have any input files available, you can download any of the ones from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in GitHub.
  * Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine for Unstructured API to send the processed output in JSON format.


Ingest CLI
You must first [install the Unstructured Ingest CLI](https://docs.unstructured.io/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli).
Because you are calling a private API and therefore do not need an Unstructured API key, you can omit the command-line option `--api-key` Or, for better code portability, it is recommended that you first set the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to an empty string and then include the command-line option `--api-key`.
CLI
Copy
```
unstructured-ingest \
 local \
  --input-path $LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR \
  --output-dir $LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR \
  --partition-by-api \
  --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
  --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
  --strategy hi_res \
  --additional-partition-args="{\"split_pdf_page\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_allow_failed\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_concurrency_level\": 15}"

```

Ingest Python library
You must first [install the Unstructured Ingest Python library](https://docs.unstructured.io/ingestion/python-ingest).
Because you are calling a private API and therefore do not need an Unstructured API key, you can omit the parameter `api_key`. Or, for better code portability, it is recommended that you first set the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to an empty string and then include the parameter `api_key`.

Load balancer network settings
Unstructured recommends the following load balancer settings, which you should set on your deployment’s load balancer soon after you finalize and deploy it.
On the load balancer’s **Overview** tab in the Azure portal:
  * **SKU** : **Standard**


On the load balancer’s **Settings** tab in the Azure portal:
  * **Frontend IP configuration** : Private IP
  * **Backend pools** : VMSS
  * **Health probes** :
    * **Protocol** : **HTTP** , or **HTTPS** (this requires setting up a reverse proxy on the VMSS set to do TLS termination)
    * **Port** : `80` or `443` (this can be any port that the backend VMs are listening on)
    * **Path** : `/healthcheck`
    * **Interval (seconds)** : `5`
  * **Load balancing rules** :
    * **Protocol** : **TCP**
    * **Port** : `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
    * **Backend port** : `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
    * **Idle timeout (minutes)** : `60`
    * **Enable TCP Reset** box: Checked
  * **Inbound NAT rules** :
    * **Frontend Port** : `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
    * **Backend port** : `443` for HTTPS, or `80` for HTTP
    * **Protocol** : **TCP**
    * **Enable TCP Reset** box: Checked
    * **Idle timeout (minutes)** : `60`


## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/azure#api-environment-variables)
API environment variables
Unstructured supports the following environment variables, which you can set in the Docker image on the virtual machine, as needed:
  * `ALLOW_ORIGINS`: CORS-allowed origins.
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_ALLOWED_MIMETYPE`: The list of allowed MIME types, if you want to limit the file types that can be processed.
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`: The default Unstructured API key to use.
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_MEMORY_FREE_MINIMUM_MB`: The minimum amount of free memory in MB to allow for processing a file. If this memory is too low, the server will return a `503` error.
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_PDF_HI_RES_MAX_PAGES`: The maximum number of pages in a PDF file that the Unstructured API will not reject, if the `hi_res` strategy is used. The default is `300`.
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_REDIRECT_ROOT_URL`: If this is set, redirect a `GET` request to the Unstructured API to use this URL instead.

6
Finalize and deploy
  1. Click **Review + create**.
  2. Wait for validation.
  3. Click **Create**.
![deployment](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/api/Azure_Step6.png)


7
Post-deployment: additional load balancer configuration
  1. Go to your load balancer: in the Azure portal’s **Search resources, services and docs** box, enter and then select **Load balancers**.
  2. Search for and open the new load balancer that you created earlier, or the existing load balancer that you chose earlier.
  3. Make any necessary settings updates to your new or existing load balancer, based on the recommended configurations in the [Load balancer network settings](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/azure#load-balancer-network-settings) section, later on this page.


8
Post-deployment: get the deployed endpoint URL
  1. Go to your virtual machine: in the Azure portal’s **Search resources, services and docs** box, enter and then select **Virtual machines**.
  2. Search for and open the new virtual machine that you created earlier, using the name that you entered earlier.
  3. On the **Overview** tab, under **Properties** , note the **Public IP address** for the **Load balancer**.
![retrieve public ip](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/api/Azure_Step7.png)
  4. The deployed endpoint URL is **http:// <load-balancer-public-IP-address>/general/v0/general**. Note this endpoint URL, as you will need it later to call the Unstructured API.


9
Post-deployment: set API environment variables
Note the API environment variables in the [API environment variables](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/azure#api-environment-variables) section, later on this page. If you need to set any of these in the Docker container on the virtual machine, do the following:
  1. If the virtual machine is not already running from earlier, click the **Start** icon.
  2. After the virtual machine starts, click the **Connect** icon, and then click **Connect** from the drop-down list.
  3. Follow the on-screen directions for one of the available options to connect to the virtual machine and display a connected terminal.
  4. Stop the running container in the virtual machine, so that you can restart it later with the environment variables set: In the connected terminal, run the following command: `sudo docker container ls`.
  5. Note the `CONTAINER ID` value for the running container.
  6. Run the following command, replacing `<CONTAINER ID>` with the `CONTAINER ID` value:
Copy
```
sudo docker container rm --force <CONTAINER ID>

```

  7. Now run the container again, setting the environment variables at the same time: Run the following command: `sudo docker image ls`.
  8. Note the `REPOSITORY` and `TAG` value for the Docker image.
  9. Run the following command, replacing `<REPOSITORY>` and `<TAG>` with the `REPOSITORY` and `TAG` values for the Docker image, and replacing `<VAR1>=<value1>`, `<VAR2>=<value2>` and so on with the environment variable name and value pairs:
Copy
```
sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
-p 80:5000 \
-e <VAR1>=<value1> -e <VAR2>=<value2> -e <VAR3>=<value3> \
<REPOSITORY>:<TAG>

```

  10. Verify that the environment variables were set correctly: Run the following command:
Copy
```
sudo docker container ls

```

  11. Note the `CONTAINER ID` value for the running container.
  12. Run the following command, replacing `<CONTAINER ID>` with the `CONTAINER ID` value:


Copy
```

# Unstructured API on AWS
Follow these steps to deploy the Unstructured API service into your AWS account.
The Unstructured API on AWS is deprecated. It is no longer supported and is not being actively updated. Unstructured is now available on the AWS Marketplace as a private offering. To explore supported options for running Unstructured within your virtual private cloud (VPC), email Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
This page is not being actively updated. It might contain out-of-date information. This page is provided for legacy reference purposes only.
This article describes how to create several interrelated resources in your AWS account. Your AWS account will be charged on an ongoing basis for these resources, even if you are not actively using them. Manually stopping or terminating the associated Amazon EC2 instances alone will not reduce these ongoing charges. To stop accruing all related ongoing charges, you must delete all of the associated AWS resources. To do this, see [Manage related AWS account costs](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/aws#manage-related-aws-account-costs).
_Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes_
The requirements are as follows.
  1. **An AWS account** :
     * If you have an existing account, log in: [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com) > **Sign In to the Console**.
     * If you do not have an existing account, create one: <https://aws.amazon.com/free> > **Create a Free Account**.
  2. **IAM permissions** : In a later step, AWS CloudFormation creates required infrastructure in your account. To learn how to create the associated role, see [Creating IAM Roles with AWS CloudFormation](https://blog.awsfundamentals.com/aws-iam-roles-with-aws-cloudformation#heading-creating-iam-roles-with-aws-cloudformation).
  3. **SSH key pair** : For secure access to the Amazon EC2 instance that CloudFormation creates in a later step, create an SSH key pair. To learn how, see [Create a key pair for your Amazon EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html).

Part I: Setting up the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
_Note: If you have already configured a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for your organization that meets the requirements for deploying the Unstructured API, you may skip this part and proceed to the Part II. Ensure that your existing VPC setup includes the necessary subnets, internet gateway, and route tables as outlined in this guide._
In Part I, you will construct a resilient and secure infrastructure within AWS by setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Your VPC will encompass a dual-tiered subnet model consisting of both **public** and **private** subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
You will establish the foundational network structure for deploying the Unstructured API by creating two public subnets and one private subnet within your VPC. The public subnets will host resources that require direct access to the internet, such as a load balancer, enabling them to communicate with external users. The private subnet is designed for resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet, like EC2 Compute Engine.

  1. **Access the VPC dashboard** :
a. In the AWS Management Console, in the top menu bar, click **Services > Networking & Content Delivery > VPC**.
b. In the sidebar, click **Your VPCs** , and then click **Create VPC**.
  2. **Create the VPC** :
a. Select **VPC only**.
b. Enter a **Name tag** for your VPC.
c. Specify the **IPv4 CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).
d. You may leave **IPv6 CIDR block** , **Tenancy** , and **Tags** settings at their defaults.
e. Click **Create VPC**.', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/aws", "source": "docs.unstructured.io", "headers": "# Unstructured API on AWS; ##

a. The CloudFormation details page for the stack appears. If you do not see it, on the sidebar, click **Stacks** , and then click the name of your stack.
b. Check the status of the CloudFormation stack. A successful deployment will show a **CREATE_COMPLETE** value for the **Status** field on the **Stack Info** tab on this stack’s details page. The deployment can take several minutes.
c. After a successful deployment, click the **Resources** tab on this stack’s details page. Then click the **Physical ID** link next to **ApplicationLoadBalancer** on this tab.
d. On the **EC2 > Load balancers > (Load balancer ID)** page that appears, copy the **DNS Name** value, which is shown as an **(A Record)** and ends with `.elb.amazonaws.com`.
  * Note: You will use this **DNS Name** to replace the `<application-load-balancer-dns-name>` for the following healthcheck and data processing steps.

Healthcheck
Perform a health check by running this [curl](https://curl.se/) command from a terminal on your local machine, replacing `<application-load-balancer-dns-name>` with your application load balancer’s DNS name. This health check can take several minutes:
Copy
```
curl http://<application-load-balancer-dns-name>/healthcheck

```

Data processing
For example, run one of the following, setting the following environment variables to make your code more portable:
  * Set `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to `http://`, followed by your load balancer’s DNS name, followed by `/general/v0/general`.
You can now use this value (`http://`, followed by your load balancer’s DNS name, followed by `/general/v0/general`) in place of calling the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview) URL as described elsewhere in the Unstructured API documentation.
  * Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine to the files for the Unstructured API to process. If you do not have any input files available, you can download any of the ones from the [example-docs](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-ingest/tree/main/example-docs) folder in GitHub.
  * Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR` to the path on your local machine for Unstructured API to send the processed output in JSON format:


Ingest CLI
You must first [install the Unstructured Ingest CLI](https://docs.unstructured.io/ingestion/overview#unstructured-ingest-cli).
Because you are calling a private API and therefore do not need an Unstructured API key, you can omit the command-line option `--api-key` Or, for better code portability, it is recommended that you first set the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to an empty string and then include the command-line option `--api-key`.
CLI
Copy
```
unstructured-ingest \
 local \
  --input-path $LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_DIR \
  --output-dir $LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_DIR \
  --partition-by-api \
  --api-key $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY \
  --partition-endpoint $UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL \
  --strategy hi_res \
  --additional-partition-args="{\"split_pdf_page\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_allow_failed\":\"true\", \"split_pdf_concurrency_level\": 15}"

```

Ingest Python library
You must first [install the Unstructured Ingest Python library](https://docs.unstructured.io/ingestion/python-ingest).
Because you are calling a private API and therefore do not need an Unstructured API key, you can omit the parameter `api_key`. Or, for better code portability, it is recommended that you first set the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` to an empty string and then include the parameter `api_key`.

  1. **Create the subnets** :
a. After creating the VPC, in the sidebar, click **Subnets**.
b. Click **Create subnet**.
c. In the **VPC ID** dropdown menu. select the VPC that you just created.
d. For the first public subnet:
     * Enter a **Subnet name**.
     * Select an **Availability Zone**.
     * Specify the **IPv4 CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).
     * Specify the **IPv4 subnet CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.1.0/24`).
     * You may leave the **Tags** setting at its default.
     * Click **Add new subnet**. (Do not click **Create subnet** yet.)
e. Repeat the process for the second public subnet with a different **Availability Zone** and **IPv4 subnet CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.2.0/24`).
     * _Note: Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. If you specify the same Availability Zone or IPv4 subnet CIDR block as the first public subnet, AWS CloudFormation might fail in a later step_.
     * To learn more, see [Subnet basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-basics).
     * Click **Add new subnet**. (Do not click **Create subnet** yet.)
f. Repeat the process for the private subnet with a different **Availability Zone** and **IPv4 subnet CIDR block** (for example, `10.0.3.0/24`).
     * _Note: Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. If you specify the same Availability Zone or IPv4 subnet CIDR block as the first or second public subnets, AWS CloudFormation might fail in a later step_.
g. Click **Create subnet**.


![create subnet](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/api/VPC_Step3.png)
  1. **Create the internet gateway (for the public subnets)** :
a. In the sidebar, click **Internet gateways**.
b. Click **Create internet gateway** , enter a **Name tag** , and click **Create internet gateway**.
c. In the sidebar, click **Internet gateways** again.
d. Click the **Internet gateway ID** for the internet gateway that you just created.
e. Click **Actions > Attach to VPC**.
f. In the **Available VPCs** dropdown list, select the VPC from _Step 2 - Create the VPC_.
g. Click **Attach internet gateway**.


![create internet gateway](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/api/VPC_Step4.png)
  1. **Set up route tables (for the public subnets)** :
AWS automatically created a default route table in _Step 3 - Create the subnets_. To tailor your network architecture, you will create a new route table specifically for your public subnets, which will include a route to the internet gateway from _Step 4 - Create the internet gateway (for the public subnets)_.
a. In the sidebar, click _Route tables_.
b. Click **Create route table**.
c. Enter a **Name**.
d. Select the **VPC** from _Step 2 - Create the VPC_.
e. Click **Create route table**.


![create route table](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/api/VPC_Step5.png)
  1. **Associate public subnets to the route table and internet gateway** :
a. Connect the **public subnets** to the **route table** from _Step 5 - Set up route tables (for the public subnets)_ :
     * In the sidebar, click **Subnets**.
     * Select the first public subnet from _Step 3 - Create the subnets_.
     * Click **Actions > Edit route table association**.
     * In the **Route table ID** dropdown list, select the route table from _Step 5 - Set up route tables (for the public subnets)_ , and then click **Save**.
     * Repeat the process for the second public subnet.
b. Now, you’ll ensure that the two public subnets can access the internet by connecting the route table to the internet gateway:
     * In the sidebar, click **Route tables**.
     * Select the route table from _Step 5 - Set up route tables (for the public subnets)_.
     * Click **Actions > Edit routes**.
     * Click **Add route** , in the destination box, enter `0.0.0.0/0`, which represents all IP addresses. In the **Target** dropdown list, select **Internet Gateway** , and select the internet gateway from _Step 4 - Create the internet gateway (for the public subnets)_.
     * Click **Save changes** to establish the route, granting internet access to the first and second public subnets at the same time.
c. For the **private subnet** :
     * In the sidebar, click **Subnets**.
     * Select the private subnet from _Step 3 - Create the subnets_.
     * Click **Actions > Edit route table association**.
     * In the **Route table ID** dropdown list, select the main route table, or create and then select a new route table without a route to the internet gateway.
     * Click **Save**.', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/aws", "source": "docs.unstructured.io", "headers": "##

element matches search criteria.


Metadata is tracked at the element level. You can access the metadata for a given document element with `element.metadata`. For a dictionary representation, use `element.metadata.to_dict()`.
###

Common metadata fields
All document types return the following metadata fields when the information is available from the source file:
Metadata field name| Description  
---|---  
`filename`| Filename  
`file_directory`| File directory  
`last_modified`| Last modified Date  
`filetype`| File type  
`coordinates`| XY Bounding Box Coordinates. See notes below for further details about the bounding box.  
`parent_id`| Element Hierarchy. `parent_id` may be used to infer where an element resides within the overall hierarchy of a document. For instance, a NarrativeText element may have a Title element as a parent (a “sub-title”), which in turn may have another Title element as its parent (a “title”).  
`category_depth`| Element depth relative to other elements of the same category. Category depth is the depth of an element relative to other elements of the same category. It’s set by a document partitioner and enables the hierarchy post-processor to compute more accurate hierarchies. Category depth may be set using native document hierarchies, e.g. reflecting <H1>, <H2>, or <H3> tags within an HTML document or the indentation level of a bulleted list item in a Word document.  
`text_as_html`| HTML representation of extracted tables. Only applicable to table elements.  
`languages`| Document Languages. At document level or element level. List is ordered by probability of being the primary language of the text.  
`emphasized_text_contents`| Emphasized text (bold or italic) in the original document.  
`emphasized_text_tags`| Tags on text that is emphasized in the original document.  
`is_continuation`| True if element is a continuation of a previous element. Only relevant for chunking, if an element was divided into two due to max_characters.  
`detection_class_prob`| Detection model class probabilities. From unstructured-inference, hi-res strategy.  
Notes on common metadata fields:
#### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#metadata-for-document-hierarchy)
Metadata for document hierarchy
`parent_id` and `category_depth` enhance hierarchy detection to identify the document structure in various file formats by measuring relative depth of an element within its category. This is especially useful in documents with native hierarchies like HTML or Word files, where elements like headings or list items inherently define structure.
#### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#element%E2%80%99s-coordinates)
Element’s coordinates
Some document types support location data for the elements, usually in the form of bounding boxes. If it exists, an element’s location data is available with `element.metadata.coordinates`. The `coordinates` property of an `ElementMetadata` stores:
  * `points` : These specify the corners of the bounding box starting from the top left corner and proceeding counter-clockwise. The points represent pixels, the origin is in the top left and the `y` coordinate increases in the downward direction.
  * `system`: The points have an associated coordinate system. A typical example of a coordinate system is `PixelSpace`, which is used for representing the coordinates of images. The coordinate system has a name, orientation, layout width, and layout height.


The Unstructured Open Source library offers a way to change the coordinates of an element to a new coordinate system by using the `Element.convert_coordinates_to_new_system` method. If the `in_place` flag is `True`, the coordinate system and points of the element are updated in place and the new coordinates are returned. If the `in_place` flag is `False`, only the altered coordinates are returned.

”by_page” chunking strategy
Only available in the Unstructured UI and API.
The `by_page` chunking strategy ensures the content from different pages do not end up in the same chunk. When a new page is detected, the existing chunk is completed and a new one is started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk.
### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/chunking#%E2%80%9Dby-similarity%E2%80%9D-chunking-strategy)
”by_similarity” chunking strategy
Only available in Unstructured API and Platform.
The `by_similarity` chunking strategy employs the `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` embedding model to identify topically similar sequential elements and combine them into chunks.
As with other strategies, chunks will never exceed the hard-maximum chunk size set by `max_characters`. For this reason, not all elements that share a topic will necessarily appear in the same chunk. However, with this strategy you can guarantee that two elements with low similarity will not be combined in a single chunk.
You can control the level of topic similarity you require for elements to have by setting the `similarity_threshold` parameter. `similarity_threshold` expects a value between 0.0 and 1.0 specifying the minimum similarity text in consecutive elements must have to be included in the same chunk. The default is 0.5.

Partition Endpoint
# Document elements and metadata
`unstructured` simplifies and streamline the preprocessing of structured and unstructured documents for downstream tasks. What that means is no matter where your data is and no matter what format that data is in, Unstructured’s toolkit will transform and preprocess that data into an easily digestible and usable format that is uniform across data formats.
When you partition a document with Unstructured, the result is a list of document `Element` objects. These element objects represent different components of the source document.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#element-example)
Element example
Here’s an example of what an element might look like:
Copy
```
{'type': 'NarrativeText',
 'element_id': '5ef1d1117721f0472c1ad825991d7d37',
 'text': 'The Unstructured API documentation covers the following API services:',
 'metadata': {'last_modified': '2024-05-01T14:15:22',
 'page_number': 1,
 'languages': ['eng'],
 'parent_id': '56f24319ae258b735cac3ec2a271b1d9',
 'file_directory': '/content',
 'filename': 'Unstructured - Unstructured.html',
 'filetype': 'text/html'}}

```

As you can see, every element will have a `type`, an `element_id`, the extracted `text`, and some `metadata` which may vary depending on the element type, document structure, and some additional parameters used during partitioning and/or chunking.
Let’s explore some of these document element components in more detail.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#element-type)
Element type
Instead of treating all documents like a wall of plain text, Unstructured preserves the semantic structure of the documents. This gives you more control and flexibility over how you further use the processed documents and allows you to take their structure into consideration. At the same time, normalizing data from various file formats to the Unstructured element type scheme lets you treat all documents the same in your downstream processing, regardless of source format. For example, if you plan to summarize a document, you may only be interested in the narrative of the document, and not care about footers and headers. You can easily filter out the elements you don’t need using their type.
Here are some examples of the element types your document may contain:
Element type| Description  
---|---  
`Formula`| An element containing formulas in a document.  
`FigureCaption`| An element for capturing text associated with figure captions.  
`NarrativeText`| NarrativeText is an element consisting of multiple, well-formulated sentences. This excludes elements such titles, headers, footers, and captions.  
`ListItem`| ListItem is a NarrativeText element that is part of a list.  
`Title`| A text element for capturing titles.  
`Address`| A text element for capturing physical addresses.  
`EmailAddress`| A text element for capturing email addresses.  
`Image`| A text element for capturing image metadata.  
`PageBreak`| An element for capturing page breaks.  
`Table`| An element for capturing tables.  
`Header`| An element for capturing document headers.  
`Footer`| An element for capturing document footers.  
`CodeSnippet`| An element for capturing code snippets.  
`PageNumber`| An element for capturing page numbers.  
`UncategorizedText`| Base element for capturing free text from within document.  
If you apply chunking during partitioning of a document or later, you will also see the `CompositeElement` type. `CompositeElement` is a chunk formed from text (non-Table) elements. It is only produced by chunking. A composite element may be formed by combining one or more sequential elements produced by partitioning. For example, several individual list items may be combined into a single chunk.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#element-id)
Element ID
By default, the element ID is a SHA-256 hash of the element’s text, its position on the page, page number it’s on, and the name of the document file - this is to ensure that the ID is deterministic and unique at the document level. To obtain globally unique IDs in the output (UUIDs), you can pass `unique_element_ids=True` into any of the partition functions. This can be helpful if you’d like to use the IDs as a primary key in a database, for example.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#metadata)
Metadata
Unstructured tracks a variety of metadata about the elements extracted from documents. Here are a couple of examples of what element metadata enables you to do:
  * filter document elements based on an element metadata value. For instance, you may want to limit your scope to elements from a certain page, or you may want to use only elements that have an email matching a regular expression in their metadata.
  * map an element to the document page where it occurred so that original page can be retrieved when that', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/chunking", "source":

[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/aws#accessing-the-hosting-ec2-instance)
Accessing the hosting EC2 instance
If you need to access the Amazon EC2 instance that hosts the Unstructured API, do the following:
  1. In the CloudFormation console, open the details page for the stack from Part II. If you do not see it, on the CloudFormation console’s sidebar, click **Stacks** , and then click the name of your stack.
  2. Click the **Resources** tab on this stack’s details page. Then click the **Physical ID** link next to **EC2TargetGroup** on this tab.
  3. On the **EC2 > Target groups > (CloudFormation stack name)** page that appears, on the **Targets** tab, click the **Instance ID** link.
  4. In the list of instances that appears, click the **Instance ID** link.
  5. Click **Connect** , and then follow any of the on-screen options to access the EC2 instance.


## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/legacy-api/aws#manage-related-aws-account-costs)
Manage related AWS account costs
After you run the CloudFormation stack that you created in Part II, charges will begin accruing to your AWS account on an ongoing basis for related AWS resources. The amounts of these charges vary based on where these resource are located, which resources are covered by AWS Free Tier offerings, the extent to which you customize these resources’ settings, how much you use these resources, and other factors. Stopping or terminating the related Amazon EC2 instances alone will not eliminate these ongoing charges.
To stop these charges from accruing, [delete the CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) that you created and ran in Part II. This stops and deletes all of the related AWS resources.
Before you delete the stack, note the following:
  * You should click the **Resources** tab on the stack’s details page to be aware of the associated resources that will be deleted.
  * You should note any resource dependencies, resources with deletion protection or termination protection enabled, or nested stacks that might prevent stack deletion, and resolve these issues that could prevent stack deletion. To find these kinds of issues:
    * On the **Template** tab on the stack’s details page, look for occurences of the `DependsOn` attribute, which are set to the name of the resource dependency.
    * On the **Template** tab on the stack’s details page, look for occurences of the `DeletionPolicy` attribute set to `Retain` or the `UpdateReplacePolicy` attribute set to `Retain`. The associated resources have deletion protection enabled.
    * On the **Stack info** tab on the stack’s details page, look for the **Termination protection** field. If it is set to **Activated** , termination protection is enabled.
    * On the **Resources** tab on the stack’s details page, look for resources with their **Type** set to `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`. These indicate nested stacks.', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/chunking", "source": "docs.unstructured.io", "headers": "###

Notes on additional metadata by document type:
#### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#email)
Email
Emails will include `sent_from`, `sent_to`, and `subject` metadata. `sent_from` is a list of strings because the [RFC 822](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822) spec for emails allows for multiple sent from email addresses.
#### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#microsoft-excel-documents)
Microsoft Excel documents
For Excel documents, `ElementMetadata` will contain a `page_name` element, which corresponds to the sheet name in the Excel document.
#### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#microsoft-word-documents)
Microsoft Word documents
Headers and footers in Word documents include a `header_footer_type` indicating which page a header or footer applies to. Valid values are `"primary"`, `"even_only"`, and `"first_page"`.
### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements#table-specific-metadata)
Table-specific metadata
For `Table` elements, the raw text of the table will be stored in the `text` attribute for the Element, and HTML representation of the table will be available in the element metadata under `element.metadata.text_as_html`. By default, Unstructured will automatically extract all tables for all doc types unless you set `skip_infer_table_types` parameter.
Here’s an example of a table element. The `text` of the element will look like this:
Copy
```
Dataset Base Model1 Large Model Notes PubLayNet [38] F / M M Layouts of modern scientific documents PRImA [3] M - Layouts of scanned modern magazines and scientific reports Newspaper [17] F - Layouts of scanned US newspapers from the 20th century TableBank [18] F F Table region on modern scientific and business document HJDataset [31] F / M - Layouts of history Japanese documents

```

And the `text_as_html` metadata for the same element will look like this:
Copy
```

Partition Endpoint
# Chunking strategies
Chunking functions use metadata and document elements detected with partition functions to split a document into appropriately-sized chunks for uses cases such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
If you are familiar with chunking methods that split long text documents into smaller chunks, you’ll notice that Unstructured methods slightly differ, since the partitioning step already divides an entire document into its structural elements.
Individual elements will only be split if they exceed the desired maximum chunk size. Two or more consecutive text elements that will together fit within `max_characters` will be combined. After chunking, you will only have elements of the following types:
  * `CompositeElement`: Any text element will become a `CompositeElement` after chunking. A composite element can be a combination of two or more original text elements that together fit within the maximum chunk size. It can also be a single element that doesn’t leave room in the chunk for any others but fits by itself. Or it can be a fragment of an original text element that was too big to fit in one chunk and required splitting.
  * `Table`: A table element is not combined with other elements and if it fits within `max_characters` it will remain as is.
  * `TableChunk`: large tables that exceed `max_characters` chunk size are split into special `TableChunk` elements.


###

”basic” chunking strategy
  * The basic strategy combines sequential elements to maximally fill each chunk while respecting both the specified `max_characters` (hard-max) and `new_after_n_chars` (soft-max) option values.
  * A single element that by itself exceeds the hard-max is isolated (never combined with another element) and then divided into two or more chunks using text-splitting.
  * A `Table` element is always isolated and never combined with another element. A `Table` can be oversized, like any other text element, and in that case is divided into two or more `TableChunk` elements using text-splitting.
  * If specified, `overlap` is applied between chunks formed by splitting oversized elements and is also applied between other chunks when `overlap_all` is `True`.


### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/chunking#%E2%80%9Dby-title%E2%80%9D-chunking-strategy)
”by_title” chunking strategy
The `by_title` chunking strategy preserves section boundaries and optionally page boundaries as well. “Preserving” here means that a single chunk will never contain text that occurred in two different sections. When a new section starts, the existing chunk is closed and a new one started, even if the next element would fit in the prior chunk.
In addition to the behaviors of the `basic` strategy above, the `by_title` strategy has the following behaviors:
  * **Detect section headings.** A `Title` element is considered to start a new section. When a `Title` element is encountered, the prior chunk is closed and a new chunk started, even if the `Title` element would fit in the prior chunk.
  * **Respect page boundaries.** Page boundaries can optionally also be respected using the `multipage_sections` argument. This defaults to `True` meaning that a page break does _not_ start a new chunk. Setting this to `False` will separate elements that occur on different pages into distinct chunks.
  * **Combine small sections.** In certain documents, partitioning may identify a list-item or other short paragraph as a `Title` element even though it does not serve as a section heading. This can produce chunks substantially smaller than desired. This behavior can be mitigated using the `combine_text_under_n_chars` argument. This defaults to the same value as `max_characters` such that sequential small sections are combined to maximally fill the chunking window. Setting this to `0` will disable section combining.', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements", "source": "docs.unstructured.io", "headers": "###

Partition Endpoint
# Extract images and tables from documents
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/extract-image-block-types#task)
Task
You want to get, decode, and show elements, such as images and tables, that are embedded in a PDF document.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/extract-image-block-types#approach)
Approach
Extract the Base64-encoded representation of specific elements, such as images and tables, in the document. For each of these extracted elements, decode the Base64-encoded representation of the element into its original visual representation and then show it.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/extract-image-block-types#to-run-this-example)
To run this example
You will need a document that is one of the document types supported by the `extract_image_block_types` argument. See the `extract_image_block_types` entry in [API Parameters](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/api-parameters). This example uses a PDF file with embedded images and tables.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/extract-image-block-types#code)
Code
For the [Unstructured Python SDK](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python), you’ll need:
These environment variables:
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` - Your Unstructured API key value.
  * `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` - Your Unstructured API URL.

[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/examples#returning-unique-element-ids)
Returning unique element IDs
By default, the element ID is a SHA-256 hash of the element text. This is to ensure that the ID is deterministic. One downside is that the ID is not guaranteed to be unique. Different elements with the same text will have the same ID, and there could also be hash collisions. To use UUIDs in the output instead, set `unique_element_ids=true`. Note: this means that the element IDs will be random, so with every partition of the same file, you will get different IDs. This can be helpful if you’d like to use the IDs as a primary key in a database, for example.

Partition Endpoint
# Examples
This page provides some examples of accessing Unstructured Partition Endpoint via different methods.
To use these examples, you’ll first need to set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`, representing your Unstructured API key. [Get your API key](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview).
For the POST and Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK examples, you’ll also need to set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` to the value `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`
For the Unstructured Python SDK, you do not need to set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`, as the Python SDK uses the API URL of `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` by default. (The Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK does not have this feature yet; you must always specify the API URL.)

[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/examples#adding-the-chunking-step-after-partitioning)
Adding the chunking step after partitioning
You can combine partitioning and subsequent chunking in a single request by setting the `chunking_strategy` parameter. By default, the `chunking_strategy` is set to `None`, and no chunking is performed.

Unstructured Partition Endpoint via curl, including environment setup, running a sample command, and examining results.
---
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview#quickstart)
Quickstart
This example uses the [curl](https://curl.se/) utility on your local machine to call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint. It sends a source (input) file from your local machine to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint which then delivers the processed data to a destination (output) location, also on your local machine. Data is processed on Unstructured-hosted compute resources.
If you do not have a source file readily available, you could use for example a sample PDF file containing the text of the United States Constitution, available for download from <https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf>.
1
Set environment variables
From your terminal or Command Prompt, set the following two environment variables.
  * Replace `<your-unstructured-api-url>` with the Unstructured Partition Endpoint URL, which is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`
  * Replace `<your-unstructured-api-key>` with your Unstructured API key, which you generated earlier on this page.


Copy
```
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL=<your-unstructured-api-url>
export UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY="<your-unstructured-api-key>"

```

2
Run the curl command
Run the following `curl` command, replacing `<path/to/file>` with the path to the source file on your local machine.
If the source file is not a PDF file, then remove `;type=application/pdf` from the final `--form` option in this command.
Copy
```
curl --request 'POST' \
"$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL" \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
--header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--form 'content_type=string' \
--form 'strategy=vlm' \
--form 'vlm_model_provider=openai' \
--form 'vlm_model=gpt-4o' \
--form 'output_format=application/json' \
--form 'files=@<path/to/file>;type=application/pdf'

```

3
Examine the results
After you run the `curl` command, the results are printed to your terminal or Command Prompt. The command might take several minutes to complete.
By default, the JSON is printed without indenting or other whitespace. You can pretty-print the JSON output by using utilities such as [jq](https://jqlang.org/tutorial/) in future command runs.
You can also pipe the JSON output to a local file by using the `curl` option [-o, —output <file>](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-o) in future command runs.
You can also call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint by using the [Unstructured Python SDK](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python) or the [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts).

# Generate a JSON schema for a file
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/generate-schema#task)
Task
You want to generate a schema for a JSON file that Unstructured produces, so that you can validate, test, and document related JSON files across your systems.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/generate-schema#approach)
Approach
Use a Python package such as [genson](https://pypi.org/project/genson/) to generate schemas for your JSON files.
The `genson` package is not owned or supported by Unstructured. For questions and requests, see the [Issues](https://github.com/wolverdude/genson/issues) tab of the `genson` repository in GitHub.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/generate-schema#generate-a-schema-from-the-terminal)
Generate a schema from the terminal
1
Install genson
Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install the [genson](https://pypi.org/project/genson/) package.
Copy
```
pip install genson

```

2
Install jq
By default, `genson` generates the JSON schema as a single string without any line breaks or indented whitespace.
To pretty-print the schema that `genson` produces, install the [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) utility.
The `jq` utility is not owned or supported by Unstructured. For questions and requests, see the [Issues](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues) tab of the `jq` repository in GitHub.
3
Generate the schema
  1. Run the `genson` command, specifying the path to the input (source) JSON file, and the path to the output (target) JSON schema file to be generated. Use `jq` to pretty-print the schema’s content into the file to be generated.
Copy
```
genson "/path/to/input/file.json" | jq '.' > "/path/to/output/schema.json"

```

  2. You can find the generated JSON schema file in the output path that you specified.


## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/generate-schema#generate-a-schema-from-python-code)
Generate a schema from Python code
1
Install dependencies
In your Python project, install the [genson](https://pypi.org/project/genson/) package.
Copy
```
pip install genson

```

2
Add and run the schema generation code
  1. Set the following local environment variables:
     * Set `LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_PATH` to the local path to the input (source) JSON file.
     * Set `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH` to the local path to the output (target) JSON schema file to be generated.
  2. Add the following Python code file to your project:
Copy
```
import os, json
from genson import SchemaBuilder
def json_schema_from_file(
  input_file_path: str,
  output_schema_path: str
) -> None:
  try:
    with open(input_file_path, "r") as file:
      json_data = json.load(file)
    builder = SchemaBuilder()
    builder.add_object(json_data)
    schema = builder.to_schema()
    try:
      with open(output_schema_path, "w") as schema_file:
        json.dump(schema, schema_file, indent=2)
    except IOError as e:
      raise IOError(f"Error writing to output file: {e}")
    
    print(f"JSON schema successfully generated and saved to '{output_schema_path}'.")
  except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Input file '{input_file_path}' not found.")
  except IOError as e:
    print(f"I/O error occurred: {e}")
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
if __name__ == "__main__":
  json_schema_from_file(
    input_file_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FILE_INPUT_PATH"),
    output_schema_path=os.getenv("LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH")
  )

```

  3. Run the Python code file.
  4. Check the path specified by `LOCAL_FILE_OUTPUT_PATH` for the generated JSON schema file.

Partition Endpoint
# Overview
The Unstructured Partition Endpoint, part of the [Unstructured API](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/overview), is intended for rapid prototyping of Unstructured’s various partitioning strategies, with limited support for chunking. It is designed to work only with processing of local files, one file at a time. Use the [Unstructured Workflow Endpoint](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/workflow/overview) for production-level scenarios, file processing in batches, files and data in remote locations, generating embeddings, applying post-transform enrichments, using the latest and highest-performing models, and for the highest quality results at the lowest cost.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview#get-started)
Get started
To call the Unstructured Partition Endpoint, you need an Unstructured account and an Unstructured API key:
If you signed up for Unstructured through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, or if you are using a [self-hosted](https://docs.unstructured.io/self-hosted/overview) deployment of Unstructured, the following information about signing up, signing in, and getting your Unstructured API key might apply differently to you. For details, contact Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
  1. Sign in to your Unstructured account:
     * If you do not already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://unstructured.io/contact> and fill out the online form to indicate your interest.
     * If you already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://platform.unstructured.io> and sign in by using the email address, Google account, or GitHub account that is associated with your Unstructured account. The Unstructured user interface (UI) then appears, and you can start using it right away.
  2. Get your Unstructured API key:
a. In the Unstructured UI, click **API Keys** on the sidebar. b. Click **Generate API Key**. c. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key. d. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system’s clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.

Set up billing
If you initially signed up for a subscribe-and-save plan instead, of if you signed up through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page instead, your billing setup and terms will be different. For billing guidance, contact Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
You must set up your billing information to keep using the Unstructured Partition Endpoint:
![Unstructured account settings](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/ui/AccountSettings.png)
![Unstructured account payment method](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/unstructured-53/img/ui/AccountBillingPaymentMethod.png)
  1. Sign in to your Unstructured account, at <https://platform.unstructured.io>.
  2. At the bottom of the sidebar, click your user icon, and then click **Account Settings**.
  3. Click the **Billing** tab.
  4. Click **Manage Payment Method** , follow the on-screen instructions to enter or update your payment details, and then click **Save card**.


Your card is billed monthly based on your usage. The **Billing** page shows a billing overview for the current month and a list of your billing invoices.
You can save money by switching from a pay-per-page plan to a subscribe-and-save plan. To do this, go to the [Unstructured Subscribe & Save](https://unstructured.io/subscribeandsave) page and complete the on-screen instructions.
We calculate a page as follows:
  * For these file types, a page is a page, slide, or image: .pdf, .pptx, and .tiff.
  * For .docx files that have page metadata, we calculate the number of pages based on that metadata.
  * For all other file types, we calculate the number of pages as the file’s size divided by 100 KB.
  * For non-file data, we calculate a page as 100 KB of incoming data to be processed.', '{"url": "https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview", "source": "docs.unstructured.io",

Partition Endpoint
# Get element contents
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/get-elements#task)
Task
You want to get, manipulate, and print or save, the contents of the [document elements and metadata](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/document-elements) from the processed data that Unstructured returns.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/get-elements#approach)
Approach
Each element in the document elements contains fields for that element’s type, its ID, the extracted text, and associated metadata.
The programmatic approach you take to get these document elements will depend on which SDK you use:
Python SDK
For the [Unstructured Python SDK](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python), calling an `UnstructuredClient` object’s `general.partition_async` method returns a `PartitionResponse` object.
This `PartitionResponse` object’s `elements` variable contains a list of key-value dictionaries (`List[Dict[str, Any]]`). For example:
Python
Copy
```
# ...
res = await client.general.partition_async(request=req)
# Do something with the elements, for example:
save_elements_to_file(res.elements)
# ...

```

You can use standard Python [list operations](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) on this list.
You can also use standard Python [looping techniques](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#looping-techniques) on this list to access each element in this list.
To work with an individual element’s contents, you can use standard [dictionary operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) on the element.
For example:
Python
Copy
```
# ...
res = await client.general.partition_async(request=req)
for element in res.elements:
  # Do something with each element, for example:
  save_element_to_database(f"{element["element_id"]}")
  save_element_to_database(f"{element["text"]}")
  save_element_to_database(f"{element["metadata"]["filename"]}\n")
# ...

```

To serialize this list as JSON, you can:
  1. Use the `elements_from_dicts` function to convert the list of key-value dictionaries (`Iterable[Dict[str, Any]]`) into a list of elements (`Iterable[Element]`).
  2. Use the `elements_to_json` function to convert the list of elements into a JSON-formatted string and then print or save that string.


For example:
Python
Copy
```
from unstructured.staging.base import elements_from_dicts, elements_to_json
# ...
res = await client.general.partition_async(request=req)
dict_elements = elements_from_dicts(
  element_dicts=res.elements
)
elements_to_json(
  elements=dict_elements,
  indent=2,
  filename=output_filepath
)
# ...

```

JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
For the [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts), calling an `UnstructuredClient` object’s `general.partition` method returns a `Promise<PartitionResponse>` object.
This `PartitionResponse` object’s `elements` property contains an `Array` of string-value objects (`{ [k: string]: any; }[]`). For example:
TypeScript
Copy
```
// ...
client.general.partition({
  partitionParameters: {
    files: {
      content: data,
      fileName: inputFilepath
    },
    strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
    splitPdfPage: true,
    splitPdfAllowFailed: true,
    splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 15
  }
}).then((res) => {
  if (res.statusCode == 200) {
    // Do something with the elements, for example:
    saveElementsToFile(res)
  }
} // ...

```

You can use standard [Array operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) on this array.
You can also use standard `Array` techniques such as [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) to access each object in this array. For example:
TypeScript
Copy
```
// ...
client.general.partition({
  partitionParameters: {
    files: {
      content: data,
      fileName: inputFilepath
    },
    strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
    splitPdfPage: true,
    splitPdfAllowFailed: true,
    splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 15
  }
}).then((res) => {
  if (res.statusCode == 200) {
    res.forEach(element => {
      // Do something with each element, for example:
      saveElementToDatabase(`${element["element_id"]}`)
      saveElementToDatabase(`${element["text"]}`)
      saveElementToDatabase(`${element["metadata"]["filename"]}`)
    }
  }
} // ...

```

To serialize this list as JSON, you can use the standard [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) function to serialize it to JSON-formatted string and the Node.js [fs.WriteFileSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options) function to save it as a file. For example:
TypeScript

# Partitioning strategies
For certain document types, such as images and PDFs, for example, Unstructured products offer a variety of different ways to preprocess them, controlled by the `strategy` parameter.
PDF documents, for example, vary in quality and complexity. In simple cases, traditional NLP extraction techniques may be enough to extract all the text out of a document. In other cases, advanced image-to-text models are required to process a PDF. You can think of the strategies as being “rule-based” workflows (thus they are “fast”), or “model-based” workflows (slower workflow because it requires model inference, but you get “higher resolution”, thus “hi_res”). When choosing a partitioning strategy for your files, you have to be mindful of the quality/speed trade-off. To give you an example, the `fast` strategy is roughly 100x faster than leading image-to-text models.
**Available options:**
  * `auto` (default strategy): The “auto” strategy will choose the partitioning strategy based on document characteristics and the function kwargs.
  * `fast`: The “rule-based” strategy leverages traditional NLP extraction techniques to quickly pull all the text elements. “Fast” strategy is not recommended for image-based file types.
  * `hi_res`: The “model-based” strategy identifies the layout of the document. The advantage of “hi_res” is that it uses the document layout to gain additional information about document elements. We recommend using this strategy if your use case is highly sensitive to correct classifications for document elements.
  * `ocr_only`: Another “model-based” strategy that leverages Optical Character Recognition to extract text from the image-based files.
  * `vlm`: Uses a vision language model (VLM) to extract text from these file types: `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.heic`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.tiff`, and `.webp`.

7.
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-strategy)
strategy
enum<string>
default:hi_res
The strategy to use for partitioning PDF/image. Options are fast, hi_res, auto. Default: hi_res
Available options: 
`fast`, 
`hi_res`, 
`auto`, 
`ocr_only`
Examples:
`"auto"`
`"hi_res"`
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-unique-element-ids)
unique_element_ids
boolean
default:false
When `True`, assign UUIDs to element IDs, which guarantees their uniqueness (useful when using them as primary keys in database). Otherwise a SHA-256 of element text is used. Default: `False`
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-xml-keep-tags)
xml_keep_tags
boolean
default:false
If `True`, will retain the XML tags in the output. Otherwise it will simply extract the text from within the tags. Only applies to XML documents.
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-chunking-strategy)
chunking_strategy
enum<string> | null
Use one of the supported strategies to chunk the returned elements after partitioning. When 'chunking_strategy' is not specified, no chunking is performed and any other chunking parameters provided are ignored. Supported strategies: 'basic', 'by_page', 'by_similarity', or 'by_title'
Available options: 
`basic`, 
`by_page`, 
`by_similarity`, 
`by_title`
Examples:
`"by_title"`
`"basic"`
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-combine-under-n-chars)
combine_under_n_chars
integer | null
If chunking strategy is set, combine elements until a section reaches a length of n chars. Default: 500
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-include-orig-elements)
include_orig_elements
boolean | null
When a chunking strategy is specified, each returned chunk will include the elements consolidated to form that chunk as `.metadata.orig_elements`. Default: true.
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-max-characters)
max_characters
integer | null
If chunking strategy is set, cut off new sections after reaching a length of n chars (hard max). Default: 500
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-multipage-sections)
multipage_sections
boolean
default:true
If chunking strategy is set, determines if sections can span multiple sections. Default: true
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-new-after-n-chars)
new_after_n_chars
integer | null
If chunking strategy is set, cut off new sections after reaching a length of n chars (soft max). Default: 1500
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-overlap)
overlap
integer
default:0
Specifies the length of a string ('tail') to be drawn from each chunk and prefixed to the next chunk as a context-preserving mechanism. By default, this only applies to split-chunks where an oversized element is divided into multiple chunks by text-splitting. Default: 0
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-overlap-all)
overlap_all
boolean
default:false
When `True`, apply overlap between 'normal' chunks formed from whole elements and not subject to text-splitting. Use this with caution as it entails a certain level of 'pollution' of otherwise clean semantic chunk boundaries. Default: False
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-similarity-threshold)
similarity_threshold
number | null
A value between 0.0 and 1.0 describing the minimum similarity two elements must have to be included in the same chunk. Note that similar elements may be separated to meet chunk-size criteria; this value can only guarantees that two elements with similarity below the threshold will appear in separate chunks.
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/pipeline-1#body-include-slide-notes)
include_slide_notes
boolean
default:true
When `True`, slide notes from .ppt and .pptx files will be included in the response. Default: `True`

# Get chunked elements
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/get-chunked-elements#task)
Task
You want to get, and print or save, the contents of elements that have been chunked.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/get-chunked-elements#approach)
Approach
Chunked elements are typically represented in this format:

and example cURL request for processing files via the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.
---
To get your API key, do the following:
If you signed up for Unstructured through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, or if you are using a [self-hosted](https://docs.unstructured.io/self-hosted/overview) deployment of Unstructured, the following information about signing up, signing in, and getting your Unstructured API key might apply differently to you. For details, contact Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
  1. Sign in to your Unstructured account:
     * If you do not already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://unstructured.io/contact> and fill out the online form to indicate your interest.
     * If you already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://platform.unstructured.io> and sign in by using the email address, Google account, or GitHub account that is associated with your Unstructured account. The Unstructured user interface (UI) then appears, and you can start using it right away.
  2. Get your Unstructured API key:
a. In the Unstructured UI, click **API Keys** on the sidebar. b. Click **Generate API Key**. c. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key. d. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system’s clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.


The API URL is `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general`
Let’s start with a simple example in which you use [curl](https://curl.se/) to send a local PDF file (`*.pdf`) to partition via the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.
In this command, be sure to replace `<path/to/file>` with the path to your local PDF file.
Copy
```
curl --request 'POST' \
"$UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL" \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header "unstructured-api-key: $UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" \
--header 'content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--form 'content_type=string' \
--form 'strategy=vlm' \
--form 'vlm_model_provider=openai' \
--form 'vlm_model=gpt-4o' \
--form 'output_format=application/json' \
--form 'files=@<path/to/file>;type=application/pdf'

```

In the example above we’re representing the API endpoint with the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`. Note, however, that you also need to authenticate yourself with your individual API Key, represented by the environment variable `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`. Learn how to obtain an API URL and API key in the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint guide](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview).

To get the element’s chunked content, extract the contents of the element’s `text` field.
The chunked content might not contain all of its associated content. To get all of the elements that were used to derive this chunked content, extract the contents of the element’s `orig_elements` field, which is nested inside of its parent `metadata` field.
The contents of the `orig_elements` field is in compressed Base64 gzipped format. To get the content, Base64-decode the bytes, decompress them, and then decode them using UTF-8.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/get-chunked-elements#to-run-this-example)
To run this example
You will need to chunk a document during processing. This example uses a PDF file chunked into 200- to 300-character elements.
##

[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#page-splitting)
Page splitting
In order to speed up processing of large PDF files, the `split_pdf_page`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#parameter-names) parameter is `True` by default. This causes the PDF to be split into small batches of pages before sending requests to the API. The client awaits all parallel requests and combines the responses into a single response object. This is specific to PDF files and other filetypes are ignored.
The number of parallel requests is controlled by `split_pdf_concurrency_level`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#parameter-names). The default is 8 and the max is set to 15 to avoid high resource usage and costs.
If at least one request is successful, the responses are combined into a single response object. An error is returned only if all requests failed or there was an error during splitting.
This feature may lead to unexpected results when chunking because the server does not see the entire document context at once. If you’d like to chunk across the whole document and still get the speedup from parallel processing, you can:
  * Partition the PDF with `split_pdf_page` set to `True`, without any chunking parameters.
  * Store the returned elements in `results.json`.
  * Partition this JSON file with the desired chunking parameters.

### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#retries)
Retries
You can also change the defaults for retries through the `retry_config`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#parameter-names) when initializing the client. If a request to the API fails, the client will retry the request with an exponential backoff strategy up to a maximum interval of one minute. The function keeps retrying until the total elapsed time exceeds `max_elapsed_time`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#parameter-names), which defaults to one hour:

Partition Endpoint
# JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
The [Unstructured JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-js-client) client allows you to send one file at a time for processing by the Unstructured Partition Endpoint.
To use the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, you’ll first need to set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`, representing your Unstructured API key. To get your API key, do the following:
If you signed up for Unstructured through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, or if you are using a [self-hosted](https://docs.unstructured.io/self-hosted/overview) deployment of Unstructured, the following information about signing up, signing in, and getting your Unstructured API key might apply differently to you. For details, contact Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
  1. Sign in to your Unstructured account:
     * If you do not already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://unstructured.io/contact> and fill out the online form to indicate your interest.
     * If you already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://platform.unstructured.io> and sign in by using the email address, Google account, or GitHub account that is associated with your Unstructured account. The Unstructured user interface (UI) then appears, and you can start using it right away.
  2. Get your Unstructured API key:
a. In the Unstructured UI, click **API Keys** on the sidebar. b. Click **Generate API Key**. c. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key. d. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system’s clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.


## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#installation)
Installation
Before using the SDK to interact with Unstructured, install the library:
JavaScript/TypeScript
Copy
```
npm install unstructured-client

```

The SDK uses semantic versioning and major bumps could bring breaking changes. It is advised to pin your installed version.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#basics)
Basics
Let’s start with a simple example in which you send a PDF document to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint to be partitioned by Unstructured.
The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK has the following breaking changes in v0.11.0:
  * Imports under the `dist` path have moved up a level
  * Enums are now used for parameters with a set of options 
    * This includes `chunkingStrategy`, `outputFormat`, and `strategy`
  * All parameters to `partition` have moved to a `partitionParameters` object


TypeScript
TypeScript (SDK <=v0.10.6)
Copy
```
import { UnstructuredClient } from "unstructured-client";
import { PartitionResponse } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/operations";
import { Strategy } from "unstructured-client/sdk/models/shared";
import * as fs from "fs";
const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;
const client = new UnstructuredClient({
  serverURL: url,
  security: {
    apiKeyAuth: key,
  },
});
const filename = "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE";
const data = fs.readFileSync(filename);
client.general.partition({
  partitionParameters: {
    files: {
      content: data,
      fileName: filename,
    },
    strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
    splitPdfPage: true,
    splitPdfAllowFailed: true,
    splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 15
    languages: ['eng']
  }
}).then((res: PartitionResponse) => {
  if (res.statusCode == 200) {
    // Print the processed data's first element only.
    console.log(res.elements?.[0])
    // Write the processed data to a local file.
    const jsonElements = JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)
    fs.writeFileSync("PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE", jsonElements)
  }
}).catch((e) => {

Partition Endpoint
# Python SDK
The [Unstructured Python SDK](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured-python-client) client allows you to send one file at a time for processing by the [Unstructured Partition Endpoint](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/overview).
To use the Python SDK, you’ll first need to set an environment variable named `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`, representing your Unstructured API key. To get your API key, do the following:
If you signed up for Unstructured through the [For Enterprise](https://unstructured.io/enterprise) page, or if you are using a [self-hosted](https://docs.unstructured.io/self-hosted/overview) deployment of Unstructured, the following information about signing up, signing in, and getting your Unstructured API key might apply differently to you. For details, contact Unstructured Sales at sales@unstructured.io.
  1. Sign in to your Unstructured account:
     * If you do not already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://unstructured.io/contact> and fill out the online form to indicate your interest.
     * If you already have an Unstructured account, go to <https://platform.unstructured.io> and sign in by using the email address, Google account, or GitHub account that is associated with your Unstructured account. The Unstructured user interface (UI) then appears, and you can start using it right away.
  2. Get your Unstructured API key:
a. In the Unstructured UI, click **API Keys** on the sidebar. b. Click **Generate API Key**. c. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish generating the key. d. Click the **Copy** icon next to your new key to add the key to your system’s clipboard. If you lose this key, simply return and click the **Copy** icon again.


## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#installation)
Installation
Before using the SDK to interact with Unstructured, install the library:
Python
Copy
```
pip install unstructured-client

```

The SDK uses semantic versioning and major bumps could bring breaking changes. It is advised to pin your installed version. See the [migration guide](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#migration-guide), later on this page, for breaking change announcements.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#basics)
Basics
Let’s start with a simple example in which you send a PDF document to the Unstructured Partition Endpoint to be partitioned by Unstructured.
Python
Copy
```
import os, json
import unstructured_client
from unstructured_client.models import operations, shared
client = unstructured_client.UnstructuredClient(
  api_key_auth=os.getenv("UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY")
)
filename = "PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE"
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
  partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
    files=shared.Files(
      content=open(filename, "rb"),
      file_name=filename,
    ),
    strategy=shared.Strategy.VLM,
    vlm_model="gpt-4o",
    vlm_model_provider="openai",
    languages=['eng'],
    split_pdf_page=True,      # If True, splits the PDF file into smaller chunks of pages.
    split_pdf_allow_failed=True,  # If True, the partitioning continues even if some pages fail.
    split_pdf_concurrency_level=15 # Set the number of concurrent request to the maximum value: 15.
  ),
)
try:
  res = client.general.partition(
    request=req
  )
  element_dicts = [element for element in res.elements]
  
  # Print the processed data's first element only.
  print(element_dicts[0])
  # Write the processed data to a local file.
  json_elements = json.dumps(element_dicts, indent=2)
  with open("PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE", "w") as file:
    file.write(json_elements)
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

```

## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#async-partitioning)
Async partitioning
The Python SDK also has a `partition_async`. This call is equivalent to `partition` except that it can be used in a non blocking context. For instance, `asyncio.gather` can be used to concurrently process multiple files inside of a directory hierarchy, as demonstrated here:

For a code example that works with an entire directory of files instead of just a single PDF, see the [Processing multiple files](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#processing-multiple-files) section.
## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#page-splitting)
Page splitting
In order to speed up processing of large PDF files, the `splitPdfPage`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#parameter-names) parameter is `true` by default. This causes the PDF to be split into small batches of pages before sending requests to the API. The client awaits all parallel requests and combines the responses into a single response object. This is specific to PDF files and other filetypes are ignored.
The number of parallel requests is controlled by `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#parameter-names). The default is 8 and the max is set to 15 to avoid high resource usage and costs.
If at least one request is successful, the responses are combined into a single response object. An error is returned only if all requests failed or there was an error during splitting.
This feature may lead to unexpected results when chunking because the server does not see the entire document context at once. If you’d like to chunk across the whole document and still get the speedup from parallel processing, you can:
  * Partition the PDF with `splitPdfPage` set to `true`, without any chunking parameters.
  * Store the returned elements in `results.json`.
  * Partition this JSON file with the desired chunking parameters.


TypeScript
Copy
```
client.general.partition({
  partitionParameters: {
    files: {
      content: data,
      fileName: filename,
    },
    strategy: Strategy.HiRes,
    // Set to `false` to disable PDF splitting
    splitPdfPage: true,
    // Continue PDF splitting even if some earlier split operations fail.
    splitPdfAllowFailed: true,
    // Modify splitPdfConcurrencyLevel to set the number of parallel requests
    splitPdfConcurrencyLevel: 10,
  }
})

```

Customizing the client
### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#retries)
Retries
You can also change the defaults for retries through the `retryConfig`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#parameter-names) when initializing the client. If a request to the API fails, the client will retry the request with an exponential backoff strategy up to a maximum interval of one minute. The function keeps retrying until the total elapsed time exceeds `maxElapsedTime`[*](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#parameter-names), which defaults to one hour:
TypeScript
Copy
```
const key = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY;
const url = process.env.UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL;  
const client = new UnstructuredClient({
  security: { apiKeyAuth: key },
  serverURL: url,
  retryConfig: {
    strategy: "backoff",
    retryConnectionErrors: true,
    backoff: {
      initialInterval: 500,
      maxInterval: 60000,
      exponent: 1.5,
      maxElapsedTime: 900000, // 15min*60sec*1000ms = 15 minutes
    },
  };
});

```

Processing multiple files
The code example in the [Basics](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts#basics) section processes a single PDF file. But what if you want to process multiple files inside a directory with a mixture of subdirectories and files with different file types?
The following example takes an input directory path to read files from and an output directory path to write the processed data to, processing one file at a time.

### 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#disabling-ssl-validation)
Disabling SSL validation
If you disable SSL validation, requests will accept any TLS certificate presented by the server and ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired certificates, which will make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Only set this to `False` for testing.
Python
Copy
```
http_client = requests.Session()
http_client.verify = False
client = UnstructuredClient(
  client=http_client,
  ...
)

```

## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#handling-the-response)
Handling the response
The partition response defaults to a dict format that can be converted to Unstructured elements with the `elements_from_dicts` utility function as seen below. Otherwise, the API response can be sent directly to your vector store or another destination.
Python
Copy
```
from unstructured.staging.base import elements_from_dicts
# ...
if res.elements is not None:
  elements = elements_from_dicts(response.elements)

```

## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#parameters-%26-examples)
Parameters & examples
The parameter names used in this document are for the Python SDK, which follow snake_case convention. The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK follows camelCase convention. Other than this difference in naming convention, the names used in the SDKs are the same across all methods.
  * Refer to the [API parameters](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/api-parameters) page for the full list of available parameters.
  * Refer to the [Examples](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/examples) page for some inspiration on using the parameters.


## 
[​](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python#migration-guide)
Migration guide
There are breaking changes beginning with Python SDK version 0.26.0. If you encounter any errors when upgrading, please find the solution below.
**If you see the error:`AttributeError: 'PartitionParameters' object has no attribute 'partition_parameters'`**
Before 0.26.0, the SDK accepted a `PartitionParameters` object as input to the `sdk.general.partition` function. Beginning with 0.26.0, this object must be wrapped in a `PartitionRequest` object. The old behavior was deprecated in 0.23.0 and removed in 0.26.0.
Copy
```
# Instead of:
from unstructured_client.models import shared
req = shared.PartitionParameters(
  files=files,
)
resp = s.general.partition(
  request=req
)
# Switch to:
from unstructured_client.models import shared, operations
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
  partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
    files=files,
  )
)
resp = s.general.partition(
  request=req
)

```

**If you see the error:`TypeError: BaseModel.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`**
Beginning with 0.26.0, the `PartitionRequest` constructor no longer allows for positional arguments. You must specify `partition_parameters` by name.
Copy
```
# Instead of:
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
  shared.PartitionParameters(
    files=files,
  )
)
# Switch to:
req = operations.PartitionRequest(
  partition_parameters=shared.PartitionParameters(
    files=files,
  )
)

```

**If you see the error:`TypeError: General.partition() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`**
Beginning with 0.26.0, the `partition` function no longer allows for positional arguments. You must specify `request` by name.
Copy
```
# Instead of:
resp = s.general.partition(req)
# Switch to:
resp = s.general.partition(

Partition Endpoint
# Speed up processing of large files and batches
When you use Unstructured, here are some techniques that you can try to help speed up the processing of large files and large batches of files.
Choose your partitioning strategy wisely. For example, if you have simple PDFs that don’t have images and tables, you might be able to use the `fast` strategy. Try the `fast` strategy on a few of your documents before you try using the `hi_res` strategy. [Learn more](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/partitioning).
To speed up PDF file processing, the [Unstructured SDK for Python](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-python) and the [Unstructured SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/partition/sdk-jsts) provide the following parameters to help speed up processing a large PDF file:
  * `split_pdf_page` (Python) or `splitPdfPage` (JavaScript/TypeScript), when set to true (the default), splits the PDF file on the client side before sending it as batches to Unstructured for processing. The number of pages in each batch is determined internally. Batches can contain between 2 and 20 pages.
  * `split_pdf_concurrency_level` (Python) or `splitPdfConcurrencyLevel` (JavaScript/TypeScript) is an integer that specifies the number of parallel requests. The default is 5. The maximum is 15. This behavior is ignored unless `split_pdf_page` (Python) or `splitPdfPage` (JavaScript/TypeScript) is also set to true.
  * `split_pdf_allow_failed` (Python) or splitPdfAllowFailed` (JavaScript/TypeScript), when set to true, allows partitioning to continue even if some pages fail.
  * `split_pdf_page_range` (Python only) is a list of two integers that specify the beginning and ending page numbers of the PDF file to be sent. A `ValueError` is raised if the specified range is not valid. This behavior is ignored unless `split_pdf_page` is also set to true.
